# Changelog
All notable changes to ContextGem will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), with the following additional categories:

- **Refactor**: Code reorganization that doesn't change functionality but improves structure or maintainability

## [0.16.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.16.0) - 2025-08-19
### Added
- Reasoning-aware extraction prompts: Automatically enables private chain-of-thought guidance on models that support reasoning, yielding higher-quality outputs (no change for other models).

## [0.15.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.15.0) - 2025-08-14
### Added
- Auto-pricing for LLMs: enable via `auto_pricing=True` to automatically estimate costs using pydantic's `genai-prices`; optional `auto_pricing_refresh=True` refreshes cached price data at runtime.

### Refactor
- Public API made more consistent and stable: user-facing classes are now thin, well-documented facades over internal implementations. No behavior changes.
- Internal reorganization for maintainability and future-proofing.

### Docs
- Added guidance for configuring auto-pricing for LLMs.

## [0.14.4](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.14.4) - 2025-08-08
### Fixed
- Suppressed noisy LiteLLM proxy missing-dependency error logs (prompting to install `litellm[proxy]`) emitted by `litellm>=1.75.2` during LLM API calls. ContextGem does not require LiteLLM proxy features. Suppression is scoped to LiteLLM loggers.

## [0.14.3](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.14.3) - 2025-08-08
### Fixed
- Enabled `reasoning_effort` parameter for gpt-5 models by explicitly forwarding it via `allowed_openai_params`, since `litellm.get_supported_openai_params()` does not yet include this parameter for gpt-5 models.

## [0.14.2](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.14.2) - 2025-08-06
### Added
- Added warning for `gpt-oss` models used with `lm_studio/` provider due to performance issues (according to tests), with a recommendation to use Ollama as a working alternative (e.g., `ollama_chat/gpt-oss:20b`).

## [0.14.1](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.14.1) - 2025-08-06
### Added
- Added step-by-step usage guide in README, with brief descriptions of core components.
- Added new documentation on documents, extraction pipelines, and logging configuration.

### Changed
- Renamed `DocumentPipeline` to `ExtractionPipeline` to better reflect its purpose and scope. `DocumentPipeline` is maintained as a deprecated wrapper class for backwards compatibility until v1.0.0.
- Simplified logging config to use a single environment variable.

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.14.0) - 2025-08-02
### Added
- Added utility function `create_image()` for flexible image creation from various sources (file paths, PIL objects, file-like objects, raw bytes) with automatic MIME type detection.

### Changed
- Updated `image_to_base64()` utility function to accept more image source types (file-like objects and raw bytes) in addition to file paths.
- Made `temperature` and `top_p` parameters for DocumentLLM optional.

## [0.13.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.13.0) - 2025-07-30
### Changed
- Enhanced LLM prompts with XML tags for improved instruction clarity and higher-quality extraction outputs.
- Updated LabelConcept documentation with clearer distinction between multi-label and multi-class classification types.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where LabelConcept with multi-class classification type did not always return a label, as expected for multi-class classification tasks.

## [0.12.1](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.12.1) - 2025-07-27
### Added
- Explicit declaration of model vision capabilities: Added support for explicitly declaring vision capability when `litellm.supports_vision()` does not correctly identify a model's vision support. If a LLM is configured as a vision model and genuinely supports vision, but litellm fails to detect this capability, a warning will be issued. Users can manually set `_supports_vision=True` on the model instance to declare the capability and allow the model to accept image inputs.
- Warning for Ollama vision models: Added a warning prompting users to use the `ollama/` prefix instead of `ollama_chat/` for vision models, as `ollama_chat/` does not currently support image inputs.

### Changed
- Updated documentation to address vision capability detection issues and provide guidance on manual overrides.

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.12.0) - 2025-07-22
### Fixed
- BooleanConcept extraction for valid False values: Improved instructions in the concepts extraction prompt to fix a bug where no items were extracted for BooleanConcept with expected valid False values. The concept could be incorrectly considered "not addressed", resulting in empty extraction results.

### Changed
- Enhanced documentation: Added more details to parameter tables for Aspects API, Concepts API, and LLM config documentation.

## [0.11.1](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.11.1) - 2025-07-11
### Fixed
- Allow disabling system message (e.g. for basic chat interactions): Added support for omitting system messages in DocumentLLM by allowing empty strings, which prevents sending any system message to the LLM. Introduced a warning in `llm.chat()/llm.chat_async()` when the default system message (optimized for extraction tasks) is used. Updated initialization to set default system message only when needed, ensuring flexibility for basic chat without a system message.

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.11.0) - 2025-07-10
### Added
- Support for litellm versions >1.71.1: ContextGem now supports newer litellm versions that were previously incompatible with tests due to underlying transport changes (removal of httpx-aiohttp dependency) introduced after v1.71.1, which affected VCR recording used in testing.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.10.0) - 2025-07-07
### Added
- RatingConcept now supports tuple format for rating scales: Use `(start, end)` tuples instead of `RatingScale` objects for simpler API. Example: `rating_scale=(1, 5)` instead of `rating_scale=RatingScale(start=1, end=5)`.

### Deprecated
- RatingScale class is deprecated and will be removed in v1.0.0. Use tuple format `(start, end)` instead for rating scales in RatingConcept.

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.9.0) - 2025-07-02
### Added
- New exception handling for LLM extraction methods: Added `raise_exception_on_extraction_error` parameter (default is True) to LLM extraction methods. Controls whether to raise an exception when LLM returns invalid data (`LLMExtractionError`) or when there is an error calling LLM API (`LLMAPIError`). When False, warnings are issued and no extracted items are returned.

## [0.8.2](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.8.2) - 2025-06-25
### Changed
- Improved prompts

## [0.8.1](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.8.1) - 2025-06-23
### Added
- Documentation on troubleshooting issues with small models.

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.8.0) - 2025-06-22
### Changed
- Deferred SaT segmentation: SaT segmentation is now performed only when actually needed, improving both document initialization and extraction performance, as some extraction workflows may not require SaT segmentation.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.7.0) - 2025-06-16
### Added
- DocxConverter upgrade: migrated to high-performance lxml library for parsing DOCX document structure, added processing of links and inline formatting, improved conversion accuracy.
- Integrated Bandit security scanning across development pipeline.

### Changed
- Updated documentation to reflect the above changes.

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.6.1) - 2025-06-04
### Changed
- Updated documentation for LM Studio models to clarify dummy API key requirement

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 2025-06-03
### Added
- LabelConcept - a classification concept type that categorizes content using predefined labels.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 2025-05-29
### Fixed
- Params handling for reasoning (CoT-capable) models other than OpenAI o-series. Enabled automatic retry of LLM calls with dropping unsupported params if such unsupported params were set for the model. Improved handling and validation of LLM call params.

### Changed
- Migrated to wtpsplit-lite - a lightweight version of wtpsplit that only retains accelerated ONNX inference of SaT models with minimal dependencies.

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.4.1) - 2025-05-26
### Added
- Comprehensive docs on extracting aspects, extracting concepts, and LLM extraction methods

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 2025-05-20
### Added
- Support for local SaT model paths in Document's `sat_model_id` parameter

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2025-05-19
### Added
- Expanded JsonObjectConcept to support nested class hierarchies, nested dictionary structures, lists containing objects, and literal types.

## [0.2.4](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.2.4) - 2025-05-09
### Fixed
- Removed 'think' tags and content from LLM outputs (e.g. when using DeepSeek R1 via Ollama) which was breaking JSON parsing and validation

### Added
- Documentation for cloud/local LLMs and LLM configuration guide

## [0.2.3](https://github.com/shcherbak-ai/contextgem/releases/tag/v0.2.3) - 2025-05-04
### Changed
