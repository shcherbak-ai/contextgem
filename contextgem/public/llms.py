"""
Module for handling processing logic using LLMs.

This module provides classes and utilities for interacting with LLMs in document processing
workflows. It includes functionality for managing LLM configurations, handling API calls,
processing text and image inputs, tracking token usage and costs, and managing rate limits
for LLM requests.

The module supports various LLM providers through the litellm library, enabling both
text-only and multimodal (vision) capabilities. It implements efficient asynchronous
processing patterns and provides detailed usage statistics for monitoring and cost management.

    Handles processing documents with a specific LLM.

    This class serves as an abstraction for interacting with a LLM. It provides functionality

    usage tracking. The class can be configured with different roles based on the document
    processing task.

    :vartype system_message: str | None
    :ivar temperature: Sampling temperature (0.0 to 1.0) controlling response creativity.
        Lower values produce more predictable outputs, higher values generate more varied responses.
        Defaults to 0.3.
    :vartype temperature: float | None
    :ivar max_tokens: Maximum tokens allowed in the generated response. Defaults to 4096.
    :vartype max_tokens: int
    :ivar max_completion_tokens: Maximum token size for output completions in reasoning
        (CoT-capable) models. Defaults to 16000.
    :vartype max_completion_tokens: int
    :ivar reasoning_effort: The effort level for the LLM to reason about the input. Can be set to
        ``"minimal"`` (gpt-5 models only), ``"low"``, ``"medium"``, or ``"high"``.
        Relevant for reasoning (CoT-capable) models. Defaults to None.
    :vartype reasoning_effort: ReasoningEffort | None
    :ivar top_p: Nucleus sampling value (0.0 to 1.0) controlling output focus/randomness.
        Lower values make output more deterministic, higher values produce more diverse outputs.
        Defaults to 0.3.
    :vartype top_p: float | None
    :ivar num_retries_failed_request: Number of retries when LLM request fails. Defaults to 3.
    :vartype num_retries_failed_request: int

    :ivar async_limiter: Controls frequency of async LLM API requests for concurrent tasks.
        Defaults to allowing 3 acquisitions per 10-second period to prevent rate limit issues.
        See https://github.com/mjpieters/aiolimiter for configuration details.
    :vartype async_limiter: AsyncLimiter
    :ivar seed: Seed for random number generation to help produce more consistent outputs
        across multiple runs. When set to a specific integer value, the LLM will attempt
        to use this seed for sampling operations. However, deterministic output is still
        not guaranteed even with the same seed, as other factors may influence the model's
        response. Defaults to None.
    :vartype seed: int | None

    Note:

        - LLM groups
            Refer to the :class:`DocumentLLMGroup` class for more information on constructing LLM groups,
            which are a collection of LLMs with unique roles, used for complex document processing tasks.

        - LLM role
            The ``role`` of an LLM is an abstraction to differentiate between tasks of different complexity.
            For example, if an aspect/concept is assigned ``llm_role="extractor_text"``, it means that the
            aspect/concept is extracted from the document using the LLM with the ``role`` set to "extractor_text".
            This helps to channel different tasks to different LLMs, ensuring that the task is handled
            by the most appropriate model. Usually, domain expertise is required to determine the most
            appropriate role for a specific aspect/concept. But for simple use cases, you can skip the
            role assignment completely, in which case the ``role`` will default to "extractor_text".

        - Explicit capability declaration
            Model vision capabilities are automatically detected using
            ``litellm.supports_vision()``. If this function does not correctly identify your model's capabilities,
            ContextGem will typically issue a warning, and you can explicitly declare the capability by
            setting ``_supports_vision=True`` on the LLM instance.

    Example:
        .. literalinclude:: ../../../dev/usage_examples/docstrings/llms/def_llm.py
            :language: python
            :caption: LLM definition
