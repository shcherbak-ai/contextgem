"""
Module for handling concepts at aspect and document levels.

This module provides classes for defining different types of concepts that can be
extracted from documents and aspects. Concepts represent specific pieces of information
to be identified and extracted by LLMs, such as strings, numbers, boolean values,
JSON objects, and ratings.

Each concept type has specific properties and behaviors tailored to the kind of data
it represents, including validation rules, extraction methods, and reference handling.
Concepts can be attached to documents or aspects and can include examples, justifications,
and references to the source text.

    :vartype description: str
    :ivar structure: JSON object schema as a class with type annotations or dictionary where keys
        are field names and values are type annotations. All dictionary keys must be strings.
        Supports generic aliases, union types, nested dictionaries for complex hierarchical structures,
        lists of dictionaries for array items, Literal types, and classes with type annotations
        (Pydantic models, dataclasses, etc.) for nested structures. All annotated types must be
        JSON-serializable.
        Examples:

        - Simple structure: ``{"item": str, "amount": int | float}``
        - Nested structure: ``{"item": str, "details": {"price": float, "quantity": int}}``
        - List of objects: ``{"items": [{"name": str, "price": float}]}``
        - List of primitives: ``{"names": [str], "scores": [int | float], "statuses": [Literal["active", "inactive"]]}``
        - List of classes: ``{"addresses": [AddressModel], "users": [UserModel]}``
        - Literal values: ``{"status": Literal["pending", "completed", "failed"]}``
        - With type annotated classes: ``{"address": AddressModel}`` where AddressModel can be a
          Pydantic model, dataclass, or any class with type annotations

        **Note**: For lists, you can use either generic syntax (``list[str]``) or literal syntax
        (``[str]``). List instances support primitive types, unions, literals, and typed classes.
        Both ``{"items": [ClassName]}`` and ``{"items": list[ClassName]}`` are equivalent.

        **Note**: Class types cannot be used as dictionary keys or values. For example,
        ``dict[str, Address]`` is not allowed. Use alternative structures like nested objects
        or lists of objects instead.

        **Note**: When using classes that contain other classes as type hints, inherit from
        ``JsonObjectClassStruct`` in all parts of the class hierarchy, to ensure proper conversion
        of nested class hierarchies to dictionary representations for serialization.

        **Tip**: do not overcomplicate the structure to avoid prompt overloading.

      none of the specific labels apply, include a catch-all label (e.g., ``"other"``,
