"""
Module defining base classes for attribute processing in the ContextGem framework.

This module provides foundational classes that handle various attribute types including:
- Assigned instances (aspects and concepts)
- Property validation and processing
- Extracted items management
- Reference paragraphs and sentences

These base classes implement common functionality for attribute validation,
manipulation, and access control that is inherited by higher-level components.
