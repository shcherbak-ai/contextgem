{% if supports_reasoning %}

<private_reasoning>
Use private deliberation to plan, evaluate evidence, and verify decisions. Do not reveal any intermediate analysis, notes, or steps. Only output the JSON according to the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.

Follow this internal three-stage process:

1. Plan
    - Internally restate each concept in one sentence.
    - List 3-5 concrete lexical/semantic cues for relevance aligned with the concept description (include indicators of definition, obligation, permission, exception, conditionals, and negations).
    - If a concept specifies a structure, rating scale, or available labels, align inclusion/exclusion criteria with those constraints.
    - For each concept, plan how to synthesize the output value from the available evidence even when no literal span is present.

2. Evidence triage
    {% if data_type == "text" %}
    - Evaluate the provided content{% if add_references %}{% if reference_depth == "sentences" %} at paragraph and sentence levels{% else %} at paragraph level{% endif %}{% else %} holistically{% endif %}; derive candidate extractions/values for the concepts (explicit or inferred from context).
    {% elif data_type == "image" %}
    - Evaluate salient visual regions and any readable text; derive candidate extractions/values for the concepts (explicit or inferred from context).
    {% endif %}
    - Collect minimal sufficient evidence privately and note negated, hypothetical, or conditional forms.
    - Prefer precision over recall; include only high-confidence items and omit weak or ambiguous ones.

3. Consistency pass
    - Ensure all extracted items strictly match required types and any specified structure, rating scales, or label constraints.
    {% if data_type == "text" and add_references %}
    - Deduplicate referenced{% if reference_depth == "sentences" %} paragraph and sentence{% else %} paragraph{% endif %} IDs and preserve their original order.
    {% endif %}
    {% if add_justifications %}
    - Ensure justifications align with the item's evidence and stance, and comply with length and language constraints.
    {% endif %}

Never disclose any plan, evidence, or internal notes - only the JSON array defined within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.

Your task is to:
{% if data_type == "text" %}
    {% if add_references %}
        {% if reference_depth == "sentences" %}
1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.
    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, "P0", "P1", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.
    - Each paragraph includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, "P0-S0", "P0-S1", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.
            {% if additional_context_for_paras_or_sents %}
    - When available, additional context information for paragraphs and sentences (such as formatting, list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context> tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role and position within the document. Use this information to:
        -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)
        -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated data)
        -- Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)
            {% endif %}
        {% else %}
1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.
    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, "P0", "P1", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.
            {% if additional_context_for_paras_or_sents %}
    - When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting, list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context> tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role and position within the document. Use this information to:
        -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)
        -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated data)
        -- Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)
            {% endif %}
            {% if is_markdown %}
    - Note that paragraphs are provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.
            {% endif %}
        {% endif %}
    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.
    - You may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.
    {% else %}
1. Read through the document text provided.
        {% if is_markdown %}
    - Note that the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.
        {% endif %}
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.
    {% endif %}
    - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, "C0", "C1", etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.
    - Each concept is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description> tags.
{% elif data_type == "image" %}
1. Examine the attached image(s).
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the image(s).
    - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, "C0", "C1", etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.
    - Each concept is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description> tags.
{% endif %}
3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.
{% if supports_reasoning %}
    {% if data_type == "text" %}
        {% if add_references %}
    - Apply cross-paragraph reasoning when helpful (e.g., headings, lists, references like "above", "this section"): use surrounding context to disambiguate; if unresolved, omit.
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
    - Treat negations, exceptions, and conditionals carefully: relevance may involve permissions, prohibitions, requirements, exceptions, thresholds, or ranges; reflect the stance {% if add_justifications %} in the justification{% endif %}.
    - Prefer minimal sufficient evidence and value derivation:
        {% if data_type == "text" and add_references %}
            {% if reference_depth == "sentences" %}
        -- include only the sentences necessary to support the item or derived value; avoid unrelated sentences.
            {% else %}
        -- include only the paragraphs necessary to support the item or derived value; avoid tangential mentions.
            {% endif %}
        {% endif %}
    - Favor precision over recall; when uncertain, avoid speculative extractions or derivations.
{% endif %}
4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.
{% if supports_reasoning %}
    - Internally verify before finalizing:
        -- Each provided concept appears once, in order, with the correct "concept_id".
        -- The top-level structure matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.
        {% if data_type == "text" and add_references %}
            {% if reference_depth == "sentences" %}
        -- When present, each object in "reference_paragraphs" contains only valid "reference_paragraph_id" and valid "reference_sentence_ids".
            {% else %}
        -- When present, "reference_paragraph_ids" contain only valid paragraph IDs.
            {% endif %}
        {% endif %}
        {% if add_justifications %}
            {% if reference_depth == "sentences" %}
        -- No structural IDs (concept/paragraph/sentence IDs) appear inside justifications.
