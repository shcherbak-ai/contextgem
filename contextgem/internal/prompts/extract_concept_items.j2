Your task is to:

    {% if add_references %}
        {% if reference_depth == "sentences" %}
1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.
    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, "P0", "P1", etc.).
    - Each paragraph includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, "P0-S0", "P0-S1", etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence.
            {% if additional_context_for_paras_or_sents %}
    - When available, additional context information for paragraphs and sentences (such as formatting, list context, or table position) will be provided under "Additional information about the paragraph:" and "Additional information about the sentence:" sections, which provides important context for understanding their structural role and position within the document. Use this information to:
        -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)
        -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated data)
        -- Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)
            {% endif %}
        {% else %}

            {% endif %}
        {% endif %}
    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.
    - You may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.
    {% else %}
1. Read through the document text provided.
        {% if is_markdown %}
    - Note that the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.
        {% endif %}
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.
    {% endif %}
{% elif data_type == "image" %}
1. Examine the attached image(s).
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the image(s).
{% endif %}
3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.
4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.

{% if data_type == "text" %}
    {% if add_references %}
If a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty "extracted_items" list.
    {% else %}
