Your task is to:
{% if data_type == "text" %}
    {% if add_references %}
        {% if reference_depth == "sentences" %}
1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.
    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, "P0", "P1", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.
    - Each paragraph includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, "P0-S0", "P0-S1", etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence and, optionally, additional information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.
        {% else %}
1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.

        {% endif %}
    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.
    {% else %}
1. Read through the document text provided.
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.
    {% endif %}
{% elif data_type == "image" %}
1. Examine the attached image(s).
2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the image(s).
{% endif %}
3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.
4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.

{% if data_type == "text" %}
    {% if add_references %}
If a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty "extracted_items" list.
    {% else %}
If a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty "extracted_items" list.
    {% endif %}
{% elif data_type == "image" %}
If a concept is not addressed in the image(s), you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty "extracted_items" list.
{% endif %}

Follow these additional rules:

- Output format:
Provide your answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).

- Consistency:
    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: "concept_id" and "extracted_items".
    -- The value of "concept_id" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, "C0", "C1", etc.).
