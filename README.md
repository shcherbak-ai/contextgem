ContextGem is a free, open-source LLM framework that makes it radically easier to extract structured data and insights from documents ‚Äî with minimal code.


## üíé Why ContextGem?

Most popular LLM frameworks for extracting structured data from documents require extensive boilerplate code to extract even basic information. This significantly increases development time and complexity.

ContextGem addresses this challenge by providing a flexible, intuitive framework that extracts structured data and insights from documents with minimal effort. Complex, most time-consuming parts are handled with **powerful abstractions**, eliminating boilerplate code and reducing development overhead.

üü¢ - fully supported - no additional setup required<br>
üü° - partially supported - requires additional setup<br>
‚óØ - not supported - requires custom logic

\* See [descriptions](https://contextgem.dev/motivation.html#the-contextgem-solution) of ContextGem abstractions and [comparisons](https://contextgem.dev/vs_other_frameworks.html) of specific implementation examples using ContextGem and other popular open-source LLM frameworks.


## üí° With **minimal code**, you can:

- **Extract structured data** from documents (text, images)
- **Identify and analyze key aspects** (topics, themes, categories) within documents
- **Extract specific concepts** (entities, facts, conclusions, assessments) from documents
- **Build complex extraction workflows** through a simple, intuitive API
- **Create multi-level extraction pipelines** (aspects containing concepts, hierarchical aspects)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install -U contextgem
```


## üöÄ Quick start

```python
# Quick Start Example - Extracting anomalies from a document, with source references and justifications

import os

from contextgem import Document, DocumentLLM, StringConcept

# Sample document text (shortened for brevity)
doc = Document(
    raw_text=(
        "Consultancy Agreement\n"
        "This agreement between Company A (Supplier) and Company B (Customer)...\n"
        "The term of the agreement is 1 year from the Effective Date...\n"
        "The Supplier shall provide consultancy services as described in Annex 2...\n"
        "The Customer shall pay the Supplier within 30 calendar days of receiving an invoice...\n"
        "The purple elephant danced gracefully on the moon while eating ice cream.\n"  # üíé anomaly
        "This agreement is governed by the laws of Norway...\n"
    ),
)

# Attach a document-level concept
doc.concepts = [
    StringConcept(
        name="Anomalies",  # in longer contexts, this concept is hard to capture with RAG
        description="Anomalies in the document",
        add_references=True,
        reference_depth="sentences",
        add_justifications=True,
        justification_depth="brief",
        # see the docs for more configuration options
    )
    # add more concepts to the document, if needed
    # see the docs for available concepts: StringConcept, JsonObjectConcept, etc.
]
# Or use `doc.add_concepts([...])`

# Define an LLM for extracting information from the document
llm = DocumentLLM(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",  # or another provider/LLM
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "CONTEXTGEM_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ),  # your API key for the LLM provider
    # see the docs for more configuration options
)

# Extract information from the document
doc = llm.extract_all(doc)  # or use async version `await llm.extract_all_async(doc)`

# Access extracted information in the document object
print(
    doc.concepts[0].extracted_items
)  # extracted items with references & justifications
# or `doc.get_concept_by_name("Anomalies").extracted_items`

```

## üîÑ Document converters

To create a ContextGem document for LLM analysis, you can either pass raw text directly, or use built-in converters that handle various file formats.

### üìÑ DOCX converter

ContextGem provides built-in converter to easily transform DOCX files into LLM-ready data.

- Extracts information that other open-source tools often do not capture: misaligned tables, comments, footnotes, textboxes, headers/footers, and embedded images
- Preserves document structure with rich metadata for improved LLM analysis

```python
# Using ContextGem's DocxConverter

from contextgem import DocxConverter

converter = DocxConverter()

# Convert a DOCX file to an LLM-ready ContextGem Document
# from path
document = converter.convert("path/to/document.docx")
# or from file object
with open("path/to/document.docx", "rb") as docx_file_object:
    document = converter.convert(docx_file_object)

# You can also use it as a standalone text extractor
docx_text = converter.convert_to_text_format(
    "path/to/document.docx",
    output_format="markdown",  # or "raw"
)

```

Learn more about [DOCX converter features](https://contextgem.dev/converters/docx.html) in the documentation.


## üéØ Focused document analysis

ContextGem leverages LLMs' long context windows to deliver superior extraction accuracy from individual documents. Unlike RAG approaches that often [struggle with complex concepts and nuanced insights](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/raging-contracts-pitfalls-rag-contract-review-shcherbak-ai-ptg3f), ContextGem capitalizes on [continuously expanding context capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12962), evolving LLM capabilities, and decreasing costs. This focused approach enables direct information extraction from complete documents, eliminating retrieval inconsistencies while optimizing for in-depth single-document analysis. While this delivers higher accuracy for individual documents, ContextGem does not currently support cross-document querying or corpus-wide retrieval - for these use cases, modern RAG systems (e.g., LlamaIndex, Haystack) remain more appropriate.

Read more on [how ContextGem works](https://contextgem.dev/how_it_works.html) in the documentation.


## ü§ñ Supported LLMs

ContextGem supports both cloud-based and local LLMs through [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) integration:
- **Cloud LLMs**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (including Gemini models like `gemini/gemini-pro` and `gemini/gemini-pro-vision`), Azure OpenAI, and more.
- **Local LLMs**: Run models locally using providers like Ollama, LM Studio, etc.
- **Model Architectures**: Works with both reasoning/CoT-capable (e.g. o4-mini) and non-reasoning models (e.g. gpt-4.1)
- **Simple API**: Unified interface for all LLMs with easy provider switching

Learn more about [supported LLM providers and models](https://contextgem.dev/llms/supported_llms.html) and how to [configure LLMs](https://contextgem.dev/llms/llm_config.html) in the documentation.


## ‚ö° Optimizations

ContextGem documentation offers guidance on optimization strategies to maximize performance, minimize costs, and enhance extraction accuracy:

- [Optimizing for Accuracy](https://contextgem.dev/optimizations/optimization_accuracy.html)
- [Optimizing for Speed](https://contextgem.dev/optimizations/optimization_speed.html)
- [Optimizing for Cost](https://contextgem.dev/optimizations/optimization_cost.html)
- [Dealing with Long Documents](https://contextgem.dev/optimizations/optimization_long_docs.html)
- [Choosing the Right LLM(s)](https://contextgem.dev/optimizations/optimization_choosing_llm.html)


## üíæ Serializing results

ContextGem allows you to save and load Document objects, pipelines, and LLM configurations with built-in serialization methods:

- Save processed documents to avoid repeating expensive LLM calls
- Transfer extraction results between systems
- Persist pipeline and LLM configurations for later reuse

Learn more about [serialization options](https://contextgem.dev/serialization.html) in the documentation.
