Why ContextGem?
***************

ContextGem is an LLM framework designed to strike the right balance
between ease of use, customizability, and accuracy for structured data
and insights extraction from documents.

ContextGem offers the **easiest and fastest way** to build LLM
extraction workflows for document analysis through powerful
abstractions of most time consuming parts.


⏱️ Development Overhead of Other Frameworks
===========================================

Most popular LLM frameworks for extracting structured data from
documents require extensive boilerplate code to extract even basic
information. As a developer using these frameworks, you're typically
expected to:

📝 Prompt Engineering

* Write custom prompts from scratch for each extraction scenario

* Maintain different prompt templates for different extraction
  workflows

* Adapt prompts manually when extraction requirements change

🔧 Technical Implementation

* Define your own data models and implement validation logic

* Implement complex chaining for multi-LLM workflows

* Implement nested context extraction logic (*e.g. document > sections
  > paragraphs > entities*)

* Configure text segmentation logic for correct reference mapping

* Configure concurrent I/O processing logic to speed up complex
  extraction workflows

**Result:** All these limitations significantly increase development
time and complexity.


💡 The ContextGem Solution
==========================

ContextGem addresses these challenges by providing a flexible,
intuitive framework that extracts structured data and insights from
documents with minimal effort. Complex, most time-consuming parts are
handled with **powerful abstractions**, eliminating boilerplate code
and reducing development overhead.

With ContextGem, you benefit from a "batteries included" approach,
coupled with simple, intuitive syntax.

   ✅ - fully supported - no additional setup required
   ⚠️ - partially supported - requires additional setup
   ❌ - not supported - requires custom logic

   * See ContextGem and other frameworks for specific implementation
   examples comparing ContextGem with other popular open-source LLM
   frameworks. (Comparison as of 24 March 2025.)


🎯 Focused Approach
===================

ContextGem is intentionally optimized for **in-depth single-document
analysis** to deliver maximum extraction accuracy and precision. While
this focused approach enables superior results for individual
documents, ContextGem currently does not support cross-document
querying or corpus-wide information retrieval. For these use cases,
traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems over document
collections (e.g. LlamaIndex) remain more appropriate.

ContextGem and other frameworks
*******************************

Due to ContextGem's powerful abstractions, it is the **easiest and
fastest way** to build LLM extraction workflows for document analysis.


✏️ Basic Example
================

Below is a basic example of an extraction workflow - *extraction of
anomalies from a document* - implemented side-by-side in ContextGem
and other frameworks. (All implementations are self-contained.
Comparison as of 24 March 2025.)

Even implementing this basic extraction workflow requires
significantly more effort in other frameworks:

* 🔧 **Manual model definition**: Developers must define Pydantic
  validation models for structured output

* 📝 **Prompt engineering**: Crafting comprehensive prompts that guide
  the LLM effectively

* 🔄 **Output parsing logic**: Setting up parsers to handle the LLM's
  response

* 📄 **Reference mapping**: Writing custom logic for mapping
  references in the source document

In contrast, ContextGem handles all these complexities automatically.
Users simply describe what to extract in natural language, provide
basic configuration parameters, and the framework takes care of the
rest.

-[ **ContextGem** ]-

⚡ Fastest way

ContextGem is the fastest and easiest way to implement an LLM
extraction workflow. All the boilerplate code is handled behind the
scenes.

**Major time savers:**

* ⌨️ **Simple syntax**: ContextGem uses a simple, intuitive API that
  requires minimal code

* 📝 **Automatic prompt engineering**: ContextGem automatically
  constructs a prompt tailored to the extraction task

* 🔄 **Automatic model definition**: ContextGem automatically defines
  the Pydantic model for structured output

* 🧩 **Automatic output parsing**: ContextGem automatically parses the
  LLM's response

* 🔍 **Automatic reference tracking**: Precise references are
  automatically extracted and mapped to the original document

* 📏 **Flexible reference granularity**: References can be tracked at
  different levels (paragraphs, sentences)

Anomaly extraction example (ContextGem)

   # Quick Start Example - Extracting anomalies from a document, with source references and justifications

   import os

   from contextgem import Document, DocumentLLM, StringConcept

   # Sample document text (shortened for brevity)
   doc = Document(
       raw_text=(
           "Consultancy Agreement\n"
           "This agreement between Company A (Supplier) and Company B (Customer)...\n"
           "The term of the agreement is 1 year from the Effective Date...\n"
           "The Supplier shall provide consultancy services as described in Annex 2...\n"
           "The Customer shall pay the Supplier within 30 calendar days of receiving an invoice...\n"
           "The purple elephant danced gracefully on the moon while eating ice cream.\n"  # 💎 anomaly
           "This agreement is governed by the laws of Norway...\n"
       ),
   )

   # Attach a document-level concept
   doc.concepts = [
       StringConcept(
           name="Anomalies",  # in longer contexts, this concept is hard to capture with RAG
           description="Anomalies in the document",
           add_references=True,
           reference_depth="sentences",
           add_justifications=True,
           justification_depth="brief",
           # see the docs for more configuration options
       )
       # add more concepts to the document, if needed
       # see the docs for available concepts: StringConcept, JsonObjectConcept, etc.
   ]
   # Or use `doc.add_concepts([...])`

   # Define an LLM for extracting information from the document
   llm = DocumentLLM(
       model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",  # or any other LLM from e.g. Anthropic, etc.
       api_key=os.environ.get(
           "CONTEXTGEM_OPENAI_API_KEY"
       ),  # your API key for the LLM provider, e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
       # see the docs for more configuration options
   )

   # Extract information from the document
   doc = llm.extract_all(doc)  # or use async version `await llm.extract_all_async(doc)`

   # Access extracted information in the document object
   print(
       doc.concepts[0].extracted_items
   )  # extracted items with references & justifications
   # or `doc.get_concept_by_name("Anomalies").extracted_items`

-[ LangChain ]-

LangChain is a popular and versatile framework for building LLM
applications through composable components. It offers excellent
flexibility and a rich ecosystem of integrations. While powerful,
feature-rich, and widely adopted in the industry, it requires more
manual configuration and setup work for structured data extraction
tasks compared to ContextGem's streamlined approach.

**Development overhead:**

* 📝 **Manual prompt engineering**: Crafting comprehensive prompts
  that guide the LLM effectively

* 🔧 **Manual model definition**: Developers must define Pydantic
  validation models for structured output

* 🧩 **Manual output parsing**: Setting up parsers to handle the LLM's
  response

* 🔍 **Manual reference mapping**: Writing custom logic for mapping
  references

-[ LlamaIndex (RAG) ]-

LlamaIndex with RAG setup is a powerful and sophisticated framework
for document retrieval and analysis, offering exceptional capabilities
for knowledge-intensive applications. Its comprehensive architecture
excels at handling complex document interactions and information
retrieval tasks across large document collections. While it provides
robust and versatile capabilities for building advanced document-based
applications, it does require more manual configuration and
specialized setup for structured extraction tasks compared to
ContextGem's streamlined and intuitive approach.

**Development overhead:**

* 📝 **Manual prompt engineering**: Crafting comprehensive prompts
  that guide the LLM effectively

* 🔧 **Manual model definition**: Developers must define Pydantic
  validation models for structured output

* 🧩 **Manual output parsing**: Setting up parsers to handle the LLM's
  response

* 🔍 **Complex reference mapping**: Getting precise references
  correctly requires additional config, such as setting up a sentence
  splitter,  CitationQueryEngine, adjusting chunk sizes, etc.

-[ Instructor ]-

Instructor is a popular framework that specializes in structured data
extraction with LLMs using Pydantic. It offers excellent type safety
and validation capabilities, making it a solid choice for many
extraction tasks. While powerful for structured outputs, Instructor
requires more manual setup for document analysis workflows.

**Development overhead:**

* 📝 **Manual prompt engineering**: Crafting comprehensive prompts
  that guide the LLM effectively

* 🔧 **Manual model definition**: Developers must define Pydantic
  validation models for structured output

* 🔍 **Manual reference mapping**: Writing custom logic for mapping

🔬 Advanced Example
===================

As use cases grow more complex, the development overhead of
alternative frameworks becomes increasingly evident, while
ContextGem's abstractions deliver substantial time savings. As
extraction steps stack up, the implementation with other frameworks
quickly becomes *non-scalable*:

* 📝 **Manual prompt engineering**: Crafting comprehensive prompts for
  each extraction step

* 🔧 **Manual model definition**: Defining Pydantic validation models
  for each element of extraction

* 🧩 **Manual output parsing**: Setting up parsers to handle the LLM's
  response

* 🔍 **Manual reference mapping**: Writing custom logic for mapping
  references

* 📄 **Complex pipeline configuration**: Writing custom logic for
  pipeline configuration and extraction components

* 📊 **Implementing usage and cost tracking callbacks**, which quickly
  increases in complexity when multiple LLMs are used in the pipeline

* 🔄 **Complex concurrency setup**: Implementing complex concurrency
  logic with asyncio

* 📝 **Embedding examples in prompts**: Writing output examples
  directly in the custom prompts

* 📋 **Manual result aggregation**: Need to write code to collect and
  organize results

Below is a more advanced example of an extraction workflow - *using an
extraction pipeline for multiple documents, with concurrency and cost
tracking* - implemented side-by-side in ContextGem and other
frameworks. (All implementations are self-contained. Comparison as of
24 March 2025.)

-[ **ContextGem** ]-

⚡ Fastest way

ContextGem is the fastest and easiest way to implement an LLM
extraction workflow. All the boilerplate code is handled behind the
scenes.

**Major time savers:**

* ⌨️ **Simple syntax**: ContextGem uses a simple, intuitive API that
  requires minimal code

* 🔄 **Automatic model definition**: ContextGem automatically defines
  the Pydantic model for structured output

* 📝 **Automatic prompt engineering**: ContextGem automatically
  constructs a prompt tailored to the extraction task

* 🧩 **Automatic output parsing**: ContextGem automatically parses the
  LLM's response

* 🔍 **Automatic reference tracking**: Precise references are
  automatically extracted and mapped to the original document

* 📏 **Flexible reference granularity**: References can be tracked at
  different levels (paragraphs, sentences)

* 📄 **Easy pipeline definition**: Simple, declarative syntax for
  defining the extraction pipeline involving multiple LLMs, in a few
  lines of code

* 💰 **Automated usage and cost tracking**: Built-in token counting
  and cost calculation without additional setup

* 🔄 **Built-in concurrency**: Concurrent execution of extraction
  steps with a simple switch "use_concurrency=True"

* 📊 **Easy example definition**: Output examples can be easily
  defined without modifying any prompts

* 📋 **Built-in result aggregation**: Results are automatically
  collected and organized in a unified storage model (document)

-[ LangChain ]-

LangChain provides a powerful and flexible framework for building LLM
applications with excellent composability and a rich ecosystem of
integrations. While it offers great versatility for many use cases, it
does require additional manual setup and configuration for complex
extraction workflows.

**Development overhead:**

* 📝 **Manual prompt engineering**: Must craft detailed prompts for
  each extraction step

* 🔧 **Manual model definition**: Need to define Pydantic models and
  output parsers for structured data

* 🧩 **Complex chain configuration**: Requires manual setup of chains
  and their connections involving multiple LLMs

* 🔍 **Manual reference mapping**: Must implement custom logic to
  track source references

* 🔄 **Complex concurrency setup**: Implementing concurrent processing
  requires additional setup with asyncio

* 💰 **Cost tracking setup**: Requires custom logic for cost tracking
  for each LLM

* 💾 **No unified storage model**: Need to write additional code to
  collect and organize results

-[ LlamaIndex ]-

LlamaIndex provides a robust data framework for LLM applications with
excellent capabilities for knowledge retrieval and RAG. It offers
powerful tools for working with documents and structured data, though
implementing complex extraction workflows may require some additional
configuration to fully leverage its capabilities.

**Development overhead:**

* 📝 **Manual prompt engineering**: Must craft detailed prompts for
  each extraction task

* 🔧 **Manual model definition**: Need to define Pydantic models and
  output parsers for structured data

* 🧩 **Pipeline setup**: Requires manual configuration of extraction
  pipeline components involving multiple LLMs

* 🔍 **Limited reference tracking**: Basic source tracking, but
  requires additional work for fine-grained references

* 📊 **Embedding examples in prompts**: Examples must be manually
  incorporated into prompts

* 🔄 **Complex concurrency setup**: Implementing concurrent processing
  requires additional setup with asyncio

* 💰 **Cost tracking setup**: Requires custom logic for cost tracking
  for each LLM

* 💾 **No unified storage model**: Need to write additional code to
  collect and organize results

-[ Instructor ]-

Instructor is a powerful library focused on structured outputs from
LLMs with strong typing support through Pydantic. It excels at
extracting structured data with validation, but requires additional
work to build complex extraction pipelines.

**Development overhead:**

* 📝 **Manual prompt engineering**: Crafting comprehensive prompts
  that guide the LLM effectively

* 🔧 **Manual model definition**: Developers must define Pydantic
  validation models for structured output

* 🧩 **Manual pipeline assembly**: Requires custom code to connect
  extraction components involving multiple LLMs

* 🔍 **Manual reference mapping**: Must implement custom logic to
  track source references

* 📊 **Embedding examples in prompts**: Examples must be manually
  incorporated into prompts

* 🔄 **Complex concurrency setup**: Implementing concurrent processing
  requires additional setup with asyncio

* 💰 **Cost tracking setup**: Requires custom logic for cost tracking
  for each LLM

How it works
************


📏 Leveraging LLM Context Windows
=================================

ContextGem leverages LLMs' long context windows to deliver superior
extraction accuracy. Unlike RAG approaches that often struggle with
complex concepts and nuanced insights, ContextGem is betting on the
continuously expanding context capacity, evolving capabilities of
modern LLMs, and constantly decreasing LLM costs. This approach
enables direct information extraction from full documents, eliminating
retrieval inconsistencies and capturing the complete context necessary
for accurate understanding.


🧩 Core Components
==================

ContextGem's main elements are the Document, Aspect, and Concept
models:


📄 **Document**
---------------

"Document" model contains text and/or visual content representing a
specific document. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
but not limited to:
   * *Contracts*: legal agreements defining terms and obligations.

   * *Invoices*: financial documents detailing transactions and
     payments.

   * *Curricula Vitae (CVs)*: resumes outlining an individual's
     professional experience and qualifications.

   * *General documents*: any other types of documents that may
     contain text or images.


🔍 **Aspect**
-------------

"Aspect" model contains text representing a defined area or topic
within a document (or another aspect) that requires focused attention.
Each aspect reflects a specific subject or theme. For example:
   * *Contract aspects*: payment terms, parties involved, or
     termination clauses.

   * *Invoice aspects*: due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax
     details.

   * *CV aspects*: work experience, education, or skills.

Aspects may have sub-aspects, for more granular extraction with nested
context. This hierarchical structure allows for progressive refinement
of focus areas, enabling precise extraction of information from
complex documents while maintaining the contextual relationships
between different levels of content.


💡 **Concept**
--------------

Concept model contains a unit of information or an entity, derived
from an aspect or the broader document context. Concepts represent a
wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names,
dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and
answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:
   * *Factual extractions*: such as a penalty clause in a contract, a
     total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.

   * *Analytical insights*: such as risk assessments, compliance
     evaluations, or pattern identifications.

   * *Reasoned conclusions*: such as determining whether a document
     meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.

   * *Interpretative judgments*: such as ratings, classifications, or
     qualitative assessments based on document content.

Concepts may be attached to an aspect or a document. The context for
the concept extraction will be the aspect or document, respectively.
This flexible attachment allows for both targeted extraction from
specific document sections and broader analysis across the entire
document content. When attached to aspects, concepts benefit from the
focused context, enabling more precise extraction of domain-specific
information. When attached to documents, concepts can leverage the
complete context to identify patterns, anomalies, or insights that
span multiple sections.

Multiple concept types are supported: "StringConcept",
"BooleanConcept", "NumericalConcept", "DateConcept",
"JsonObjectConcept", "RatingConcept"

🔄 Extraction Workflow
======================

ContextGem uses the following models to extract information from
documents:


🤖 **DocumentLLM**
------------------

**A single configurable LLM with a specific role to extract specific
information from the document.**

The "llm_role" of an LLM is an abstraction to differentiate between
tasks of different complexity. For example, if an aspect/concept is
assigned "llm_role="extractor_text"", it means that the aspect/concept
is extracted from the document using the LLM with the role
"extractor_text". This helps to channel different tasks to different
LLMs, ensuring that the task is handled by the most appropriate model.
Usually, domain expertise is required to determine the most
appropriate role for a specific aspect/concept. But for simple use
cases, you can skip the role assignment completely, in which case the
role will default to "extractor_text".

An LLM can have any of the pre-defined roles assigned to it,
irrespective of whether it is actually a "reasoning" model (e.g.
o3-mini) or not (e.g. gpt-4o) - it is up to you to decide based on the
capabilities of the LLM and the complexity of the task.

An LLM can have a configurable fallback LLM with the same role.

See "DocumentLLM" for more details.


🤖🤖 **DocumentLLMGroup**
-------------------------

**A group of LLMs with different unique roles to extract different
information from the document.**

For more complex and granular extraction workflows, an LLM group can
be used to extract different information from the same document using
different LLMs with different roles. For example, a simpler LLM e.g.
gpt-4o-mini can be used to extract specific aspects of the document,
and a more powerful LLM e.g. o3-mini will handle the extraction of
complex concepts that require reasoning over the aspects' context.

Each LLM can have its own backend and configuration, and one fallback
LLM with the same role.

See "DocumentLLMGroup" for more details.

ℹ️ What ContextGem Doesn't Offer (Yet)
======================================

While ContextGem excels at structured data extraction from individual
documents, it's important to understand its intentional design
boundaries:


**Not a RAG framework**
-----------------------

ContextGem focuses on in-depth single-document analysis, leveraging
long context windows of LLMs for maximum accuracy and precision. It
does not offer RAG capabilities for cross-document querying or corpus-
wide information retrieval. For these use cases, traditional RAG
systems such as LlamaIndex remain more appropriate.


**Not an agent framework**
--------------------------

ContextGem is not designed as an agent framework. Based on our
research into practical extraction workflows, we believe that in-depth
single-document data extraction can be handled more efficiently with
non-agentic LLM workflows. For use cases that require agents, we
recommend using frameworks like LangChain. ContextGem can still be
easily integrated as a tool within agent frameworks due to its simple
API and clear output structure, making it an excellent choice for
document extraction tasks within larger agent-based systems.

# ==== quickstart ====

Quickstart examples
*******************

This guide will help you get started with ContextGem by walking
through basic extraction examples.

Below are complete, self-contained examples showing how to extract
data from a document using ContextGem.


🔄 Extraction Process
=====================

ContextGem follows a simple extraction process:

1. Create a "Document" instance with your content

2. Define "Aspect" instances for sections of interest

3. Define concept instances ("StringConcept", "BooleanConcept",
   "NumericalConcept", "DateConcept", "JsonObjectConcept",
   "RatingConcept") for specific data points to extract, and attach
   them to "Aspect" (for aspect context) or "Document" (for document
   context).

4. Use "DocumentLLM" or "DocumentLLMGroup" to perform the extraction

5. Access the extracted data in the document object


📋 Aspect Extraction from Document
==================================

Tip:

  Aspect extraction is useful for identifying and extracting specific
  sections or topics from documents. Common use cases include:

  * Extracting specific clauses from legal contracts

  * Identifying specific sections from financial reports

  * Isolating relevant topics from research papers

  * Extracting product features from technical documentation

   # Quick Start Example - Extracting aspect from a document

   import os

   from contextgem import Aspect, Document, DocumentLLM

   # Example document instance
   # Document content is shortened for brevity
   doc = Document(
       raw_text=(
           "Consultancy Agreement\n"
           "This agreement between Company A (Supplier) and Company B (Customer)...\n"
           "The term of the agreement is 1 year from the Effective Date...\n"
           "The Supplier shall provide consultancy services as described in Annex 2...\n"
           "The Customer shall pay the Supplier within 30 calendar days of receiving an invoice...\n"
           "This agreement is governed by the laws of Norway...\n"
       ),
   )

   # Define an aspect with optional concept(s), using natural language
   doc_aspect = Aspect(
       name="Governing law",
       description="Clauses defining the governing law of the agreement",
       reference_depth="sentences",
   )

   # Add aspects to the document
   doc.add_aspects([doc_aspect])
   # (add more aspects to the document, if needed)

   # Create an LLM for extraction
   llm = DocumentLLM(
       model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",  # or any other LLM from e.g. Anthropic, etc.
       api_key=os.environ.get("CONTEXTGEM_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  # your API key
   )

   # Extract information from the document
   extracted_aspects = llm.extract_aspects_from_document(doc)
   # or use async version llm.extract_aspects_from_document_async(doc)

   # Access extracted information
   print("Governing law aspect:")
   print(
       extracted_aspects[0].extracted_items
   )  # extracted aspect items with references to sentences
   # or doc.get_aspect_by_name("Governing law").extracted_items


🌳 Extracting Aspect with Sub-Aspects
=====================================

Tip:

  Sub-aspect extraction helps organize complex topics into logical
  components. Common use cases include:

  * Breaking down termination clauses in employment contracts into
    company rights, employee rights, and severance terms

  * Dividing financial report sections into revenue streams, expenses,
    and forecasts

  * Organizing product specifications into technical details,
    compatibility, and maintenance requirements

   # Quick Start Example - Extracting an aspect with sub-aspects

   import os

   from contextgem import Aspect, Document, DocumentLLM

   # Sample document (content shortened for brevity)
   contract_text = """
   EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
   ...
   8. TERMINATION
   8.1 Termination by the Company. The Company may terminate the Employee's employment for Cause at any time upon written notice. 
   "Cause" shall mean: (i) Employee's material breach of this Agreement; (ii) Employee's conviction of a felony; or 
   (iii) Employee's willful misconduct that causes material harm to the Company.
   8.2 Termination by the Employee. The Employee may terminate employment for Good Reason upon 30 days' written notice to the Company. 
   "Good Reason" shall mean a material reduction in Employee's base salary or a material diminution in Employee's duties.
   8.3 Severance. If the Employee's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Employee for Good Reason, 
   the Employee shall be entitled to receive severance pay equal to six (6) months of the Employee's base salary.
   ...
   """

   doc = Document(raw_text=contract_text)

   # Define termination aspect with practical sub-aspects
   termination_aspect = Aspect(
       name="Termination",
       description="Provisions related to the termination of employment",
       aspects=[  # assign sub-aspects (optional)
           Aspect(
               name="Company Termination Rights",

               description="Conditions under which the employee can terminate employment",
           ),
           Aspect(
               name="Severance Terms",
               description="Compensation or benefits provided upon termination",
           ),
       ],
   )

   # Add the aspect to the document. Sub-aspects are added with the parent aspect.
   doc.add_aspects([termination_aspect])
   # (add more aspects to the document, if needed)

   # Create an LLM for extraction
   llm = DocumentLLM(
       model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",  # or any other LLM from e.g. Anthropic, etc.
       api_key=os.environ.get(
           "CONTEXTGEM_OPENAI_API_KEY"
       ),  # your API key of the LLM provider
   )

   # Extract all information from the document
   doc = llm.extract_all(doc)

   # Get results with references in the document object
   print("\nTermination aspect:\n")
   termination_aspect = doc.get_aspect_by_name("Termination")
   for sub_aspect in termination_aspect.aspects:
       print(sub_aspect.name)
       for item in sub_aspect.extracted_items:
           print(item.value)
       print("\n")


🔍 Concept Extraction from Aspect
=================================

Tip:

  Concept extraction from aspects helps identify specific data points
  within already extracted sections or topics. Common use cases
  include:

  * Extracting payment amounts from a contract's payment terms

  * Extracting liability cap from a contract's liability section

  * Isolating timelines from delivery terms

  * Extracting a list of features from a product description

  * Identifying programming languages from a CV's experience section

   # Quick Start Example - Extracting a concept from an aspect

   import os

   from contextgem import Aspect, Document, DocumentLLM, StringConcept, StringExample

   # Example document instance
   # Document content is shortened for brevity
   doc = Document(
       raw_text=(
           "Employment Agreement\n"
           "This agreement between TechCorp Inc. (Employer) and Jane Smith (Employee)...\n"
           "The employment shall commence on January 15, 2023 and continue until terminated...\n"
           "The Employee shall work as a Senior Software Engineer reporting to the CTO...\n"
           "The Employee shall receive an annual salary of $120,000 paid monthly...\n"
           "The Employee is entitled to 20 days of paid vacation per year...\n"
           "The Employee agrees to a notice period of 30 days for resignation...\n"
           "This agreement is governed by the laws of California...\n"
       ),
   )

   # Define an aspect with a specific concept, using natural language
   doc_aspect = Aspect(
       name="Compensation",
       description="Clauses defining the compensation and benefits for the employee",
       reference_depth="sentences",
   )

   # Define a concept within the aspect

           )
       ],
       add_references=True,
       reference_depth="sentences",
   )

   # Add the concept to the aspect
   doc_aspect.add_concepts([aspect_concept])
   # (add more concepts to the aspect, if needed)

       .get_concept_by_name("Annual Salary")
       .extracted_items
   )  # extracted concept items with references to sentences


📝 Concept Extraction from Document (text)
==========================================

Tip:

  Concept extraction from text documents locates specific information
  directly from text. Common use cases include:

  * Extracting anomalies from entire legal documents

  * Identifying financial figures across multiple report sections

  * Extracting citations and references from academic papers

  * Identifying product specifications from technical manuals

  * Extracting contact information from business documents

   # Quick Start Example - Extracting a concept from a document

   import os

   from contextgem import Document, DocumentLLM, JsonObjectConcept, JsonObjectExample

   # Example document instance
   # Document content is shortened for brevity
   doc = Document(
       raw_text=(
           "Statement of Work\n"
           "Project: Cloud Migration Initiative\n"
           "Client: Acme Corporation\n"
           "Contractor: TechSolutions Inc.\n\n"
           "Project Timeline:\n"

   # Or doc.get_concept_by_name("Project Details").extracted_items


🖼️ Concept Extraction from Document (vision)
============================================

Tip:

  Concept extraction using vision capabilities processes documents
  with complex layouts or images. Common use cases include:

  * Extracting data from scanned contracts or receipts

  * Identifying information from charts and graphs in reports

  * Identifying visual product features from marketing materials

   # Quick Start Example - Extracting concept from a document with an image

   import os
   from pathlib import Path

   from contextgem import Document, DocumentLLM, Image, NumericalConcept, image_to_base64

   # Path adapted for testing
   current_file = Path(__file__).resolve()
   root_path = current_file.parents[4]
   image_path = root_path / "tests" / "invoices" / "invoice.jpg"

   # Create an image instance
   doc_image = Image(mime_type="image/jpg", base64_data=image_to_base64(image_path))

   # Example document instance holding only the image
   doc = Document(
       images=[doc_image],  # may contain multiple images
   )

   # Define a concept to extract the invoice total amount
   doc_concept = NumericalConcept(
       name="Invoice Total",
       description="The total amount to be paid as shown on the invoice",
       numeric_type="float",
       llm_role="extractor_vision",  # use vision model
   )

   # Add concept to the document
   doc.add_concepts([doc_concept])
   # (add more concepts to the document, if needed)

   # Create an LLM for extraction
   llm = DocumentLLM(
       model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",  # Using a model with vision capabilities
       api_key=os.environ.get("CONTEXTGEM_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  # your API key
       role="extractor_vision",  # mark LLM as vision model
   )

   # Extract information from the document
   extracted_concepts = llm.extract_concepts_from_document(doc)
   # or use async version: await llm.extract_concepts_from_document_async(doc)

   # Access extracted information
   print("Invoice Total:")
   print(extracted_concepts[0].extracted_items)  # extracted concept items
   # or doc.get_concept_by_name("Invoice Total").extracted_items

Advanced usage examples
***********************

Below are complete, self-contained examples demonstrating advanced
usage of ContextGem.


🔍 Extracting Aspects Containing Concepts
=========================================

Tip:

  Concept extraction is useful for extracting specific data points
  from a document or an aspect. For example, a "Payment terms" aspect
  in a contract may have multiple concepts:

  * "Payment amount"

  * "Payment due date"

  * "Payment method"

   # Advanced Usage Example - extracting a single aspect with inner concepts from a legal document

   import os

   from contextgem import Aspect, Document, DocumentLLM, StringConcept, StringExample

   # Create a document instance with e.g. a legal contract text
   # The text is shortened for brevity
   doc = Document(
       raw_text=(
           "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT\n\n"
           'This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of January 15, 2023 (the "Effective Date"), '
           'by and between ABC Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Jane Smith, an individual (the "Employee").\n\n'
           "1. EMPLOYMENT TERM\n"
           "The Company hereby employs the Employee, and the Employee hereby accepts employment with the Company, upon the terms and "
           "conditions set forth in this Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue "
           'for a period of two (2) years, unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 8 (the "Term").\n\n'
           "2. POSITION AND DUTIES\n"
           "During the Term, the Employee shall serve as Chief Technology Officer of the Company, with such duties and responsibilities "
           "as are commensurate with such position.\n\n"
           "8. TERMINATION\n"
           "8.1 Termination by the Company. The Company may terminate the Employee's employment for Cause at any time upon written notice. "
           "\"Cause\" shall mean: (i) Employee's material breach of this Agreement; (ii) Employee's conviction of a felony; or "
           "(iii) Employee's willful misconduct that causes material harm to the Company.\n"
           "8.2 Termination by the Employee. The Employee may terminate employment for Good Reason upon 30 days' written notice to the Company. "

           "Jane Smith"
       )
   )

   # Define an aspect focused on termination clauses
   termination_aspect = Aspect(
       name="Termination Provisions",

📊 Extracting Aspects and Concepts from a Document
==================================================

Tip:

  This example demonstrates how to extract both document-level
  concepts and aspect-specific concepts from a document with
  references. Using concurrency can significantly speed up extraction
  when working with multiple aspects and concepts.Document-level
  concepts apply to the entire document (like "Is Privacy Policy" or
  "Last Updated Date"), while aspect-specific concepts are tied to
  particular sections or themes within the document.

🔄 Using a Multi-LLM Pipeline to Extract Data from Several Documents
====================================================================

Tip:

  A pipeline is a reusable configuration of extraction steps. You can
  use the same pipeline to extract data from multiple documents.For
  example, if your app extracts data from invoices, you can configure
  a pipeline once, and then use it for each incoming invoice.

Choosing the Right LLM(s)
*************************


🧭 General Guidance
===================

Your choice of LLM directly affects the accuracy, speed, and cost of
your extraction pipeline. ContextGem integrates with various LLM
providers (via LiteLLM), enabling you to select models that best fit
your needs.

Since ContextGem specializes in deep single-document analysis, models
with large context windows are recommended. While each use case has
unique requirements, our experience suggests the following practical
guidelines. However, please note that for sensitive applications
(e.g., contract review) where accuracy is paramount and speed/cost are
secondary concerns, using the most capable model available for all
tasks is often the safest approach.

+----------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+


🏷️ LLM Roles
============

Each LLM serves a specific role in your pipeline, defined by the
"role" parameter. This allows different models to handle different
tasks. For instance, when an aspect or concept has
"llm_role="extractor_text"", it will be processed by an LLM with that
matching role.

You can assign any pre-defined role to an LLM regardless of whether
it's actually a "reasoning" model (like o3-mini) or not (like gpt-4o).
This abstraction helps organize your pipeline based on your assessment
of each model's capabilities and task complexity. For simpler use
cases, you can omit role assignments, which will default to
""extractor_text"".

Optimizing for Accuracy
***********************

When accuracy is paramount, ContextGem offers several techniques to
improve extraction quality, some of which are pretty obvious:

* **🚀 Use a Capable LLM**: Choose a powerful LLM model for
  extraction.

* **🪄 Use Larger Segmentation Models**: Select a larger SaT model for
  intelligent segmentation of paragraphs or sentences, to ensure the
  highest segmentation accuracy in complex documents (e.g. contracts).

* **💡 Provide Examples**: For most complex concepts, add examples to
  guide the LLM's extraction format and style.

* **🧠 Request Justifications**: For most complex aspects/concepts,
  enable justifications to understand the LLM's reasoning and instruct
  the LLM to "think" when giving an answer.

* **📏 Limit Paragraphs Per Call**: This will reduce each prompt's
  length and ensure a more focused analysis.

* **🔢 Limit Aspects/Concepts Per Call**: Process a smaller number of
  aspects or concepts in each LLM call, preventing prompt overloading.

* **🔄 Use a Fallback LLM**: Configure a fallback LLM to retry failed
  extractions with a different model.

# ==== optimizations/optimization_speed ====

Optimizing for Speed
********************

For large-scale processing or time-sensitive applications, optimize
your pipeline for speed:

* **🚀 Enable and Configure Concurrency**: Process multiple
  extractions concurrently. Adjust the async limiter to adapt to your
  LLM API setup.

* **📦 Use Smaller Models**: Select smaller/distilled LLMs that
  perform faster. (See Choosing the Right LLM(s) for guidance on
  choosing the right model.)

* **🔄 Use a Fallback LLM**: Configure a fallback LLM to retry
  extractions that failed due to rate limits.

* **⚙️ Use Default Parameters**: All the extractions will be processed
  in as few LLM calls as possible.

* **📉 Enable Justifications Only When Necessary**: Do not use
  justifications for simple aspects or concepts. This will reduce the
  number of tokens generated.

   llm.extract_all(document, use_concurrency=True)

   # ... use the extracted data ...


# ==== optimizations/optimization_cost ====

Optimizing for Cost
*******************

ContextGem offers several strategies to optimize for cost efficiency
while maintaining extraction quality:

* **💸 Select Cost-Efficient Models**: Use smaller/distilled non-
  reasoning LLMs for extracting aspects and basic concepts (e.g.
  titles, payment amounts, dates).

* **⚙️ Use Default Parameters**: All the extractions will be processed
  in as few LLM calls as possible.

* **📉 Enable Justifications Only When Necessary**: Do not use
  justifications for simple aspects or concepts. This will reduce the
  number of tokens generated.

* **📊 Monitor Usage and Cost**: Track LLM calls, token consumption,
  and cost to identify optimization opportunities.

Example of optimizing extraction for cost

   # Example of optimizing extraction for cost

   import os

   from contextgem import DocumentLLM, LLMPricing

   llm = DocumentLLM(

           input_per_1m_tokens=0.150,
           output_per_1m_tokens=0.600,
       ),  # add pricing details to track costs
   )

   # ... use the LLM for extraction ...

   # ... monitor usage and cost ...
   usage = llm.get_usage()  # get the usage details, including tokens and calls' details.
   cost = llm.get_cost()  # get the cost details, including input, output, and total costs.
   print(usage)
   print(cost)


# ==== optimizations/optimization_long_docs ====

Dealing with Long Documents
***************************

ContextGem offers specialized configuration options for efficiently
processing lengthy documents.


✂️ Segmentation Approach
========================

Unlike many systems that rely on chunking (e.g. RAG), ContextGem
intelligently segments documents into natural semantic units like
paragraphs and sentences. This preserves the contextual integrity of
the content while allowing you to configure:

* Maximum number of paragraphs per LLM call

* Maximum number of aspects/concepts to analyze per LLM call

* Maximum number of images per LLM call (if the document contains
  images)


⚙️ Effective Optimization Strategies
====================================

* **🔄 Use Long-Context Models**: Select models with large context
  windows. (See Choosing the Right LLM(s) for guidance on choosing the
  right model.)

* **📏 Limit Paragraphs Per Call**: This will reduce each prompt's
  length and ensure a more focused analysis.

* **🔢 Limit Aspects/Concepts Per Call**: Process a smaller number of
  aspects or concepts in each LLM call, preventing prompt overloading.

* **⚡ Optional: Enable Concurrency**: Enable running extractions
  concurrently if your API setup permits. This will reduce the overall
  processing time. (See Optimizing for Speed for guidance on
  configuring concurrency.)

Since each use case has unique requirements, experiment with different
configurations to find your optimal setup.

# ==== api/documents ====

Documents
*********

Module for handling documents.

This module provides the Document class, which represents a structured
or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents
can be processed to extract information, analyze content, and organize
data into paragraphs, sentences, aspects, and concepts.

The Document class supports various operations including: - Managing
raw text and structured paragraphs - Handling embedded or attached
images - Organizing content into aspects for focused analysis -
Associating concepts for information extraction - Processing documents
through pipelines for automated analysis

Documents serve as the primary container for content analysis within
the ContextGem framework, enabling complex document understanding and
information extraction workflows.

class contextgem.public.documents.Document(**data)

   Bases: "_AssignedInstancesProcessor"

   Represents a document containing textual and visual content for
   analysis.

   A document serves as the primary container for content analysis
   within the ContextGem framework, enabling complex document
   understanding and information extraction workflows.

   Variables:
      * **raw_text** -- The main text of the document as a single
        string. Defaults to None.

      * **paragraphs** -- List of Paragraph instances in consecutive
        order as they appear in the document. Defaults to an empty
        list.

      * **images** -- List of Image instances attached to or
        representing the document. Defaults to an empty list.

      * **aspects** -- List of aspects associated with the document
        for focused analysis. Validated to ensure unique names and
        descriptions. Defaults to an empty list.

      * **concepts** -- List of concepts associated with the document
        for information extraction. Validated to ensure unique names
        and descriptions. Defaults to an empty list.

      * **paragraph_segmentation_mode** -- Mode for paragraph
        segmentation. When set to "sat", uses a SaT (Segment Any Text
        https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16678) model. Defaults to
        "newlines".

      * **sat_model_id** -- SaT model ID for paragraph/sentence
        segmentation. Defaults to "sat-3l-sm". See https://github.com
        /segment-any-text/wtpsplit for the list of available models.

   Parameters:
      * **custom_data** (*dict*)

      * **raw_text** (*Optional**[**NonEmptyStr**]*)

      * **paragraphs** (*list**[**Paragraph**]*)

      * **images** (*list**[**Image**]*)

      * **aspects** (*list**[**Aspect**]*)

      * **concepts** (*list**[**_Concept**]*)

      * **paragraph_segmentation_mode** (*Literal**[**"newlines"**,
        **"sat"**]*)

      * **sat_model_id** (*SaTModelId*)

   Note:
      Normally, you do not need to construct/populate paragraphs
      manually, as they are populated automatically from document's
      "raw_text" attribute. Only use this constructor for advanced use
      cases, such as when you have a custom paragraph segmentation
      tool.

   Example:
      Document definition

         from contextgem import Document

         # Create a document with raw text content
         contract_document = Document(
             raw_text=(

                 "All parties must comply with the terms outlined herein. The terms include "
                 "monthly reporting requirements and quarterly performance reviews.\n\n"
                 "Failure to adhere to these terms may result in termination of the agreement. "
                 "Additionally, any breach of confidentiality will be subject to penalties as "
                 "described in this agreement.\n\n"
                 "This agreement shall remain in force for a period of three (3) years unless "
                 "otherwise terminated according to the provisions stated above..."
             ),
             paragraph_segmentation_mode="newlines",  # Default mode, splits on newlines
         )

         # Create a document with more advanced paragraph segmentation using a SaT model
         report_document = Document(
             raw_text=(
                 "Executive Summary "
                 "This report outlines our quarterly performance. "
                 "Revenue increased by [15%] compared to the previous quarter.\n\n"
                 "Customer satisfaction metrics show positive trends across all regions..."
             ),
             paragraph_segmentation_mode="sat",  # Use SaT model for intelligent paragraph segmentation
             sat_model_id="sat-3l-sm",  # Specify which SaT model to use
         )

Aspects
*******

Module for handling document aspects.

This module provides the Aspect class, which represents a defined area
or topic within a document that requires focused attention. Aspects
are used to identify and extract specific subjects or themes from
documents according to predefined criteria.

Aspects can be associated with concepts, reference paragraphs and
sentences from the source document, and can be configured with
different LLM roles for extraction and reasoning tasks.

The module integrates with the broader ContextGem framework for
document analysis and information extraction.

class contextgem.public.aspects.Aspect(**data)

   Bases: "_AssignedInstancesProcessor",
   "_ExtractedItemsAttributeProcessor",
   "_RefParasAndSentsAttrituteProcessor"

   Represents an aspect with associated metadata, sub-aspects,
   concepts, and logic for validation.

   An aspect is a defined area or topic within a document that
   requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
   subject or theme described in the task.

   Variables:
      * **name** -- The name of the aspect. Required, non-empty
        string.

      * **description** -- A detailed description of the aspect.
        Required, non-empty string.

      * **concepts** -- A list of concepts associated with the aspect.
        These concepts must be unique in both name and description and
        cannot include concepts with vision LLM roles.

      * **llm_role** -- The role of the LLM responsible for aspect
        extraction. Default is "extractor_text". Valid roles are
        "extractor_text" and "reasoner_text".

      * **reference_depth** -- The structural depth of references
        (paragraphs or sentences). Defaults to "paragraphs". Affects
        the structure of "extracted_items".

      * **add_justifications** -- Whether the LLM will output
        justification for each extracted item. Inherited from base
        class. Defaults to False.

      * **justification_depth** -- The level of detail for
        justifications. Inherited from base class. Defaults to
        "brief".

      * **justification_max_sents** -- Maximum number of sentences in
        a justification. Inherited from base class. Defaults to 2.

   Parameters:
      * **custom_data** (*dict*)

      * **add_justifications** (*bool*)

      * **justification_depth** (*JustificationDepth*)

      * **justification_max_sents** (*int*)

      * **name** (*NonEmptyStr*)

      * **description** (*NonEmptyStr*)

      * **aspects** (*list**[**Aspect**]*)

      * **concepts** (*list**[**_Concept**]*)

      * **llm_role** (*LLMRoleAspect*)

      * **reference_depth** (*ReferenceDepth*)

   Example:
      Aspect definition

         from contextgem import Aspect

         # Define an aspect focused on termination clauses
         termination_aspect = Aspect(
             name="Termination provisions",
             description="Contract termination conditions, notice requirements, and severance terms.",
             reference_depth="sentences",
             add_justifications=True,
             justification_depth="comprehensive",
         )

   Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from
   keyword arguments.

   Raises [*ValidationError*][pydantic_core.ValidationError] if the
   input data cannot be validated to form a valid model.

Concepts
********

Module for handling concepts at aspect and document levels.

This module provides classes for defining different types of concepts
that can be extracted from documents and aspects. Concepts represent
specific pieces of information to be identified and extracted by LLMs,
such as strings, numbers, boolean values, JSON objects, and ratings.

Each concept type has specific properties and behaviors tailored to
the kind of data it represents, including validation rules, extraction
methods, and reference handling. Concepts can be attached to documents
or aspects and can include examples, justifications, and references to
the source text.

class contextgem.public.concepts.StringConcept(**data)

   Bases: "_Concept"

   A concept model for string-based information extraction from
   documents and aspects.

   This class provides functionality for defining, extracting, and
   managing string data as conceptual entities within documents or
   aspects.

   Variables:
      * **name** -- The name of the concept (non-empty string,
        stripped).

      * **description** -- A brief description of the concept (non-
        empty string, stripped).

      * **examples** -- Example strings illustrating the concept
        usage.

      * **llm_role** -- The role of the LLM responsible for extracting
        the concept ("extractor_text", "reasoner_text",
        "extractor_vision", "reasoner_vision"). Defaults to
        "extractor_text".

      * **add_justifications** -- Whether to include justifications
        for extracted items.

      * **justification_depth** -- Justification detail level.
        Defaults to "brief".

      * **justification_max_sents** -- Maximum sentences in
        justification. Defaults to 2.

      * **add_references** -- Whether to include source references for
        extracted items.

      * **reference_depth** -- Source reference granularity
        ("paragraphs" or "sentences"). Defaults to "paragraphs". Only
        relevant when references are added to extracted items. Affects
        the structure of "extracted_items".

      * **singular_occurrence** -- Whether this concept is restricted
        to having only one extracted item. If True, only a single
        extracted item will be extracted. Defaults to False (multiple
        extracted items are allowed). Note that with advanced LLMs,
        this constraint may not be strictly required as they can often
        infer the appropriate cardinality from the concept's name,
        description, and type (e.g., "document title" vs "key
        findings").

   Parameters:
      * **custom_data** (*dict*)

      * **add_justifications** (*bool*)

      * **justification_depth** (*JustificationDepth*)

      * **justification_max_sents** (*int*)

      * **name** (*NonEmptyStr*)

      * **description** (*NonEmptyStr*)

      * **llm_role** (*LLMRoleAny*)

      * **add_references** (*bool*)

      * **reference_depth** (*ReferenceDepth*)

      * **singular_occurrence** (*StrictBool*)

      * **examples** (*list**[**StringExample**]*)

   Example:
      String concept definition

         from contextgem import StringConcept, StringExample

         # Define a string concept for identifying contract party names
         # and their roles in the contract
         party_names_and_roles_concept = StringConcept(
             name="Party names and roles",
             description=(

class contextgem.public.concepts.JsonObjectConcept(**data)

   Bases: "_Concept"

   A concept model for structured JSON object extraction from
   documents and aspects.

   This class handles identification and extraction of structured data
   in JSON format, with validation against a predefined schema
   structure.

   Variables:
      * **name** -- The name of the concept (non-empty string,
        stripped).

      * **description** -- A brief description of the concept (non-
        empty string, stripped).

      * **structure** -- JSON object schema as a class with type
        annotations or dictionary where keys are field names and
        values are type annotations. Supports generic aliases and
        union types. All annotated types must be JSON-serializable.
        Example: "{"item": str, "amount": int | float}". **Tip**: do
        not overcomplicate the structure to avoid prompt overloading.
        If you need to enforce a nested structure (e.g. an object
        within an object), use type hints together with examples that
        will guide the output format. E.g. structure "{"item":
        dict[str, str]}" and example "{"item": {"name": "item1",
        "description": "description1"}}".

      * **examples** -- Example JSON objects illustrating the concept
        usage.

      * **llm_role** -- The role of the LLM responsible for extracting
        the concept ("extractor_text", "reasoner_text",
        "extractor_vision", "reasoner_vision"). Defaults to
        "extractor_text".

      * **add_justifications** -- Whether to include justifications
        for extracted items.

      * **justification_depth** -- Justification detail level.
        Defaults to "brief".

      * **justification_max_sents** -- Maximum sentences in
        justification. Defaults to 2.

      * **add_references** -- Whether to include source references for
        extracted items.

      * **reference_depth** -- Source reference granularity
        ("paragraphs" or "sentences"). Defaults to "paragraphs". Only
        relevant when references are added to extracted items. Affects
        the structure of "extracted_items".

      * **singular_occurrence** -- Whether this concept is restricted
        to having only one extracted item. If True, only a single
        extracted item will be extracted. Defaults to False (multiple
        extracted items are allowed). Note that with advanced LLMs,
        this constraint may not be strictly required as they can often
        infer the appropriate cardinality from the concept's name,
        description, and type (e.g., "document title" vs "key
        findings").

   Parameters:
      * **custom_data** (*dict*)

      * **add_justifications** (*bool*)

      * **justification_depth** (*JustificationDepth*)

      * **justification_max_sents** (*int*)

Examples
********

Module for handling example data in document processing.

This module provides classes for defining examples that can be used to
guide LLM extraction tasks. Examples serve as reference points for the
model to understand the expected format and content of extracted
information. The module supports different types of examples including
string-based examples and structured JSON object examples.

Examples can be attached to concepts to provide concrete illustrations
of the kind of information to be extracted, improving the accuracy and
consistency of LLM-based extraction processes.

class contextgem.public.examples.StringExample(**data)

   Bases: "_Example"

   Represents a string example that can be provided by users for
   certain extraction tasks.

   Variables:
      **content** -- A non-empty string that holds the text content of
      the example.

   Parameters:
      * **custom_data** (*dict*)

      * **content** (*NonEmptyStr*)

   Note:
      Examples are optional and can be used to guide LLM extraction
      tasks. They serve as reference points for the model to
      understand the expected format and content of extracted
      information. StringExample can be attached to a "StringConcept".

   Example:
      String example definition

         from contextgem import StringConcept, StringExample

         # Create string examples
         string_examples = [
             StringExample(content="X (Client)"),
             StringExample(content="Y (Supplier)"),
         ]

         # Attach string examples to a StringConcept
         string_concept = StringConcept(
             name="Contract party name and role",
             description="The name and role of the contract party",
             examples=string_examples,  # Attach the example to the concept (optional)
         )

   Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from
   keyword arguments.

LLMs
****

Module for handling processing logic using LLMs.

This module provides classes and utilities for interacting with LLMs
in document processing workflows. It includes functionality for
managing LLM configurations, handling API calls, processing text and
image inputs, tracking token usage and costs, and managing rate limits
for LLM requests.

The module supports various LLM providers through the litellm library,
enabling both text-only and multimodal (vision) capabilities. It
implements efficient asynchronous processing patterns and provides
detailed usage statistics for monitoring and cost management.

class contextgem.public.llms.DocumentLLMGroup(**data)

   Bases: "_GenericLLMProcessor"

   Represents a group of DocumentLLMs with unique roles for processing
   document content.

   This class manages multiple LLMs assigned to specific roles for
   text and vision processing. It ensures role compliance and
   facilitates extraction of aspects and concepts from documents.

   Variables:
      * **llms** -- A list of DocumentLLM instances, each with a
        unique role (e.g., *extractor_text*, *reasoner_text*,
        *extractor_vision*, *reasoner_vision*). At least 2 instances
        with distinct roles are required.

      * **output_language** -- Language for produced output text
        (justifications, explanations). Values: "en" (always English)
        or "adapt" (matches document/image language). All LLMs in the
        group must share the same output_language setting.

   Note:
      Refer to the "DocumentLLM" class for more information on
      constructing LLMs for the group.

        context for LLM responses.

      * **temperature** -- Sampling temperature (0.0 to 1.0)
        controlling response creativity. Lower values produce more
        predictable outputs, higher values generate more varied
        responses. Defaults to 0.3.

        model. Defaults to False.

      * **fallback_llm** -- DocumentLLM to use as fallback if current
        one fails. Must have the same role as the current LLM.

      * **output_language** -- Language for produced output text
        (justifications, explanations). Can be "en" (English) or
        "adapt" (adapts to document/image language). Defaults to "en".

      * **async_limiter** -- Controls frequency of async LLM API
        requests for concurrent tasks. Defaults to allowing 3
        acquisitions per 10-second period to prevent rate limit
        issues. See https://github.com/mjpieters/aiolimiter for
        configuration details.

      * **seed** -- Seed for random number generation to help produce
        more consistent outputs across multiple runs. When set to a
        specific integer value, the LLM will attempt to use this seed
        for sampling operations. However, deterministic output is
        still not guaranteed even with the same seed, as other factors
        may influence the model's response. Defaults to None.

   Parameters:

   Note:

      * LLM groups
           Refer to the "DocumentLLMGroup" class for more information
           on constructing LLM groups, which are a collection of LLMs
           with unique roles, used for complex document processing
           tasks.

      * LLM role
           The "role" of an LLM is an abstraction to differentiate
           between tasks of different complexity. For example, if an
           aspect/concept is assigned "llm_role="extractor_text"", it
           means that the aspect/concept is extracted from the
           document using the LLM with the "role" set to
           "extractor_text". This helps to channel different tasks to
           different LLMs, ensuring that the task is handled by the
           most appropriate model. Usually, domain expertise is
           required to determine the most appropriate role for a
           specific aspect/concept. But for simple use cases, you can
           skip the role assignment completely, in which case the
           "role" will default to "extractor_text".

   Example:
      LLM definition

         from contextgem import DocumentLLM, LLMPricing

         # Create a single LLM for text extraction
         text_extractor = DocumentLLM(
             model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
             api_key="your-api-key",  # Replace with your actual API key
             role="extractor_text",  # Role for text extraction
             pricing_details=LLMPricing(  # optional
                 input_per_1m_tokens=0.150, output_per_1m_tokens=0.600
             ),
         )

         # Create a fallback LLM in case the primary model fails
         fallback_text_extractor = DocumentLLM(
             model="anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet",
             api_key="your-anthropic-api-key",  # Replace with your actual API key
             role="extractor_text",  # must be the same as the role of the primary LLM
             is_fallback=True,
             pricing_details=LLMPricing(  # optional
                 input_per_1m_tokens=3.00, output_per_1m_tokens=15.00
             ),
         )
         # Assign the fallback LLM to the primary LLM
         text_extractor.fallback_llm = fallback_text_extractor

   Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from
   keyword arguments.

   Raises [*ValidationError*][pydantic_core.ValidationError] if the
   input data cannot be validated to form a valid model.

   property async_limiter: AsyncLimiter

   property is_group: bool

      Abstract property, to be implemented by subclasses.

      Whether the LLM is a single instance or a group.

   property list_roles: list[Literal['extractor_text', 'reasoner_text', 'extractor_vision', 'reasoner_vision']]

      Returns a list containing the role of this LLM.

      (For a single LLM, this returns a list with just one element -
      the LLM's role. For LLM groups, the method implementation
      returns roles of all LLMs in the group.)

      Returns:
         A list containing the role of this LLM.

      Return type:
         list[LLMRoleAny]

   _update_default_prompt(prompt_path, prompt_type)

      For advanced users only!

      Update the default Jinja2 prompt template for the LLM.

      This method allows you to replace the built-in prompt templates
      with custom ones for specific extraction types. The framework
      uses these templates to guide the LLM in extracting structured
      information from documents.

      The custom prompt must be a valid Jinja2 template and include
      all the necessary variables that are present in the default
      prompt. Otherwise, the extraction may fail. Default prompts are
      located under "contextgem/internal/prompts/"

      IMPORTANT NOTES:

      The default prompts are complex and specifically designed for
      various steps of LLM extraction with the framework. Such prompts
      include the necessary instructions, template variables, nested
      structures and loops, etc.

      Only use custom prompts if you MUST have a deeper customization
      and adaptation of the default prompts to your specific use case.
      Otherwise, the default prompts should be sufficient for most use
      cases.

      Use at your own risk!

      Parameters:
         * **prompt_path** (*str** | **Path*) -- Path to the Jinja2
           template file (.j2 extension required)

         * **prompt_type** (*DefaultPromptType*) -- Type of prompt to
           update ("aspect" or "concept")

      Return type:
         "None"

   _eq_deserialized_llm_config(other)

      Custom config equality method to compare this DocumentLLM with a
      deserialized instance.

      Compares the __dict__ of both instances and performs specific
      checks for certain attributes that require special handling.

      Note that, by default, the reconstructed deserialized
      DocumentLLM will be only partially equal (==) to the original
      one, as the api credentials are redacted, and the attached
      prompt templates, async limiter, and async lock are not
      serialized and point to different objects in memory post-
      initialization. Also, usage and cost are reset by default pre-
      serialization.

      Parameters:
         **other** (*DocumentLLM*) -- Another DocumentLLM instance to
         compare with

      Returns:
         True if the instances are equal, False otherwise

      Return type:
         bool

   get_usage()

      Retrieves the usage information of the LLM and its fallback LLM
      if configured.

      This method collects token usage statistics for the current LLM
      instance and its fallback LLM (if configured), providing
      insights into API consumption.

      Returns:
         A list of usage statistics containers for the LLM and its
         fallback.

      Return type:
         list[_LLMUsageOutputContainer]

   get_cost()

      Retrieves the accumulated cost information of the LLM and its
      fallback LLM if configured.

      This method collects cost statistics for the current LLM
      instance and its fallback LLM (if configured), providing
      insights into API usage expenses.

      Returns:
         A list of cost statistics containers for the LLM and its
         fallback.

      Return type:
         list[_LLMCostOutputContainer]

   reset_usage_and_cost()

      Resets the usage and cost statistics for the LLM and its
      fallback LLM (if configured).

      This method clears accumulated usage and cost data, which is
      useful when processing multiple documents sequentially and
      tracking metrics for each document separately.

      Return type:
         "None"

      Returns:
         None

# ==== api/images ====

Images
******

Module for handling document images.

This module provides the Image class, which represents visual content
that can be attached to or fully represent a document. Images are
stored in base64-encoded format with specified MIME types to ensure
proper handling.

The module supports common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP) and
integrates with the broader ContextGem framework for document analysis
that includes visual content alongside textual information.

class contextgem.public.images.Image(**data)

   Bases: "_InstanceBase"

   Represents an image with specified MIME type and base64-encoded
   data. An image is typically attached to a document, or fully
   represents a document.

   Variables:
      * **mime_type** -- The MIME type of the image. This must be one
        of the predefined valid types ("image/jpg", "image/jpeg",
        "image/png", "image/webp").

      * **base64_data** -- The base64-encoded data of the image. The
        util function *image_to_base64()* from contextgem.public.utils
        can be used to encode images to base64.

   Parameters:
      * **custom_data** (*dict*)

      * **mime_type** (*Literal**[**"image/jpg"**, **"image/jpeg"**,
        **"image/png"**, **"image/webp"**]*)

      * **base64_data** (*NonEmptyStr*)

   Note:
      * Attached to documents:
           An image must be attached to a document. A document can
           have multiple images.

      * Extraction types:
           Only concept extraction is supported for images. Use LLM
           with role ""extractor_vision"" or ""reasoner_vision"" to
           extract concepts from images.

# ==== api/paragraphs ====

Paragraphs
**********

Module for handling document paragraphs.

This module provides the Paragraph class, which represents a
structured segment of text within a document. Paragraphs serve as
containers for sentences and maintain the raw text content of the
segment they represent.

The module supports validation to ensure data integrity and provides
mechanisms to prevent inconsistencies during document analysis by
restricting certain attribute modifications after initial assignment.

class contextgem.public.paragraphs.Paragraph(**data)

   Bases: "_ParasAndSentsBase"

   Represents a paragraph of a document with its raw text content and
   constituent sentences.

   Paragraphs are immutable text segments that can contain multiple
   sentences. Once sentences are assigned to a paragraph, they cannot
   be changed to maintain data integrity during analysis.

   Variables:
      * **raw_text** -- The complete text content of the paragraph.
        This value is frozen after initialization.

      * **sentences** -- The individual sentences contained within the
        paragraph. Defaults to an empty list. Cannot be reassigned
        once populated.

   Parameters:
      * **custom_data** (*dict*)

      * **additional_context** (*Annotated**[**str**,
        **Strict**(**strict=True**)**,
        **StringConstraints**(**strip_whitespace=True**,
        **to_upper=None**, **to_lower=None**, **strict=None**,
        **min_length=1**, **max_length=None**, **pattern=None**)**]
        **| **None*)

      * **raw_text** (*NonEmptyStr*)

      * **sentences** (*list**[**Sentence**]*)

   Note:
      Normally, you do not need to construct paragraphs manually, as
      they are populated automatically from document's "raw_text"
      attribute. Only use this constructor for advanced use cases,
      such as when you have a custom paragraph segmentation tool.

   Example:
      Paragraph definition

         from contextgem import Paragraph

         # Create a paragraph with raw text content
         contract_paragraph = Paragraph(
             raw_text=(
                 "This agreement is effective as of January 1, 2025. "
                 "All parties must comply with the terms outlined herein. "

# ==== api/pipelines ====

Pipelines
*********

Module for handling document processing pipelines.

This module provides the DocumentPipeline class, which represents a
reusable collection of pre-defined aspects and concepts that can be
assigned to documents. Pipelines enable standardized document analysis
by packaging common extraction patterns into reusable units.

Pipelines serve as templates for document processing, allowing
consistent application of the same analysis approach across multiple
documents. They encapsulate both the structural organization (aspects)
and the specific information to extract (concepts) in a single,
assignable object.

class contextgem.public.pipelines.DocumentPipeline(**data)

   Bases: "_AssignedInstancesProcessor"

   Represents a reusable collection of predefined aspects and concepts
   for document analysis.

   Document pipelines serve as templates that can be assigned to
   multiple documents, ensuring consistent application of the same
   analysis criteria. They package common extraction patterns into
   reusable units, allowing for standardized document processing.

   Variables:
      * **aspects** -- A list of aspects to extract from documents.
        Aspects represent structural categories of information.
        Defaults to an empty list.

      * **concepts** -- A list of concepts to identify within
        documents. Concepts represent specific information elements to
        extract. Defaults to an empty list.

   Parameters:
      * **custom_data** (*dict*)

      * **aspects** (*list**[**Aspect**]*)

      * **concepts** (*list**[**_Concept**]*)
