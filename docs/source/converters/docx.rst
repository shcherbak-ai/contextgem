‚ÑπÔ∏è Current Limitations
------------------------

DocxConverter has the following limitations:

* Drawings such as charts are skipped as it is challenging to represent them in text format.
* Inline markdown formatting (bold, italic, etc.) and hyperlink formatting are not supported in specially marked sections (headers, footers, footnotes, comments).
* Extraction of generated table of contents (ToC) is not supported. (A ToC is an automatically generated list of document headings with page numbers that Word creates based on heading styles.)
