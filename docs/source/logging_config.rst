:og:description: ContextGem: Logging Configuration Guide


Logging Configuration
========================

ContextGem provides comprehensive logging to help you monitor and debug the extraction process. You can control logging behavior using environment variables. ContextGem uses a **namespaced logger** under the name ``contextgem``.


‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables
--------------------------

ContextGem uses a single environment variable for logging configuration:

**CONTEXTGEM_LOGGER_LEVEL**
  Sets the logging level. Valid values are:

  * ``TRACE`` - Most verbose, shows all log messages
  * ``DEBUG`` - Shows debug information and above
  * ``INFO`` - Shows informational messages and above (default)
  * ``SUCCESS`` - Shows success messages and above
  * ``WARNING`` - Shows warnings and errors only
  * ``ERROR`` - Shows errors and critical messages only
  * ``CRITICAL`` - Shows only critical messages
  * ``OFF`` - Completely disables logging

  **Default:** ``INFO``

.. warning::
   **Not recommended:** Setting the level to ``OFF`` or above ``INFO`` (such as ``WARNING`` or ``ERROR``) may cause you to miss helpful messages, guidance, recommendations, and important information about the extraction process. The default ``INFO`` level provides a good balance of useful information without being too verbose.


üîß Setting Environment Variables
----------------------------------

**Before importing ContextGem:**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Set logging level to WARNING
   export CONTEXTGEM_LOGGER_LEVEL=WARNING
   
   # Disable logging completely
   export CONTEXTGEM_LOGGER_LEVEL=OFF

**In Python before import:**

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   
   # Set logging level to DEBUG
   os.environ["CONTEXTGEM_LOGGER_LEVEL"] = "DEBUG"
   
   # Import ContextGem after setting environment variables
   import contextgem


üîÑ Changing Settings at Runtime
---------------------------------

If you need to change logging settings after importing ContextGem, use the ``reload_logger_settings()`` function:

.. literalinclude:: ../../dev/usage_examples/docstrings/utils/reload_logger_settings.py
   :language: python
   :caption: Changing logger settings at runtime


üìã Log Format
---------------

ContextGem logs use the following format:

.. code-block:: text

   [contextgem] 2025-01-11 15:30:45.123 | INFO    | Your log message here

Each log entry includes:

* Timestamp (with milliseconds)
* Log level
* Log message
