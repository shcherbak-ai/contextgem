    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"<introduction>\nYou will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\": str,\n        \"paragraph_ids:

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"<introduction>\nYou will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\": str,\n        \"paragraph_ids:
      [\n            str,\n            ...\n        ]\n    },\n    ...\n]\n</answer_format>\n\n<aspects>\nDOCUMENT

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"<introduction>\nYou will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\": str,\n        \"paragraph_ids:
      [\n            str,\n            ...\n        ]\n    },\n    ...\n]\n</answer_format>\n\n<aspects>\nDOCUMENT

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT
      (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,

      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL

      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no
      items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items
      may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each object should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id:
      Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph
      ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\",
      \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding
      an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on
      which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to

      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --

      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --

      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no
      items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items
      may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each object should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id:
      Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph
      ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\",
      \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding
      an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on
      which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no
      items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items
      may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each object should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id:
      Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph
      ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\",
      \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding
      an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on
      which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or

      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required

      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no
      items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items
      may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each object should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id:
      Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph
      ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\",
      \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding
      an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on
      which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:

      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important

      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature

      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -

      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no
      items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items
      may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each object should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id:
      Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph
      ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\",
      \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding
      an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on
      which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining

      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER

      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and

      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents

      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,

      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML

      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether

      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.

      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.\n    - Each paragraph
      is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\n    -
      You may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    - Each concept is identified
      by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id>
      tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraph_ids\". If the concept is not addressed or there are
      no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only
      leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraph_ids:
      Mandatory field holding the IDs of the document paragraphs based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Ensure such paragraphs directly tie the
      extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>","role":"user"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<private_reasoning>\nUse
      private deliberation to plan, evaluate evidence, and verify decisions. Do not
      reveal any intermediate analysis, notes, or steps. Only output the JSON according
      to the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n\nFollow
      this internal three-stage process:\n\n1. Plan\n    - Internally restate each
      concept in one sentence.\n    - List 3-5 concrete lexical/semantic cues for
      relevance aligned with the concept description (include indicators of definition,
      obligation, permission, exception, conditionals, and negations).\n    - If a
      concept specifies a structure, rating scale, or available labels, align inclusion/exclusion
      criteria with those constraints.\n    - For each concept, plan how to synthesize
      the output value from the available evidence even when no literal span is present.\n\n2.
      Evidence triage\n    - Evaluate the provided content holistically; derive candidate
      extractions/values for the concepts (explicit or inferred from context).\n    -
      Collect minimal sufficient evidence privately and note negated, hypothetical,
      or conditional forms.\n    - Prefer precision over recall; include only high-confidence
      items and omit weak or ambiguous ones.\n\n3. Consistency pass\n    - Ensure
      all extracted items strictly match required types and any specified structure,
      rating scales, or label constraints.\n\nNever disclose any plan, evidence, or
      internal notes - only the JSON array defined within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags.\n</private_reasoning>\n\n<task_description>\nYour task is to:\n1. Read
      through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the
      concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    - Each concept is
      identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified within
      <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a concept
      name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a concept description
      specified within <concept_description></concept_description> tags.\n3. For each
      concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The
      item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n    - Treat negations,
      exceptions, and conditionals carefully: relevance may involve permissions, prohibitions,
      requirements, exceptions, thresholds, or ranges; reflect the stance .\n    -
      Prefer minimal sufficient evidence and value derivation:\n    - Favor precision
      over recall; when uncertain, avoid speculative extractions or derivations.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n    -
      Internally verify before finalizing:\n        -- Each provided concept appears
      once, in order, with the correct \"concept_id\".\n        -- The top-level structure
      matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n        --
      Item values strictly satisfy type and any specified structure/scale/labels constraints.\n        --
      The structure exactly matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags (no extra keys or commentary).\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n- Private deliberation only:\n    -- Do not output any
      analysis, plan, scratchpad, thoughts, or chain-of-thought.\n    -- Only output

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:

      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>","role":"user"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<private_reasoning>\nUse
      private deliberation to plan, evaluate evidence, and verify decisions. Do not
      reveal any intermediate analysis, notes, or steps. Only output the JSON according
      to the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n\nFollow
      this internal three-stage process:\n\n1. Plan\n    - Internally restate each
      concept in one sentence.\n    - List 3-5 concrete lexical/semantic cues for
      relevance aligned with the concept description (include indicators of definition,
      obligation, permission, exception, conditionals, and negations).\n    - If a
      concept specifies a structure, rating scale, or available labels, align inclusion/exclusion
      criteria with those constraints.\n    - For each concept, plan how to synthesize
      the output value from the available evidence even when no literal span is present.\n\n2.
      Evidence triage\n    - Evaluate the provided content holistically; derive candidate
      extractions/values for the concepts (explicit or inferred from context).\n    -
      Collect minimal sufficient evidence privately and note negated, hypothetical,
      or conditional forms.\n    - Prefer precision over recall; include only high-confidence
      items and omit weak or ambiguous ones.\n\n3. Consistency pass\n    - Ensure
      all extracted items strictly match required types and any specified structure,
      rating scales, or label constraints.\n    - Ensure justifications align with
      the item''s evidence and stance, and comply with length and language constraints.\n\nNever
      disclose any plan, evidence, or internal notes - only the JSON array defined
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n</private_reasoning>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n    -
      Treat negations, exceptions, and conditionals carefully: relevance may involve
      permissions, prohibitions, requirements, exceptions, thresholds, or ranges;
      reflect the stance  in the justification.\n    - Prefer minimal sufficient evidence
      and value derivation:\n    - Favor precision over recall; when uncertain, avoid
      speculative extractions or derivations.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing
      your extracted data, in the provided format.\n    - Internally verify before
      finalizing:\n        -- Each provided concept appears once, in order, with the
      correct \"concept_id\".\n        -- The top-level structure matches the format
      specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n        -- No structural
      IDs (concept/paragraph IDs) appear inside justifications.\n        -- Justifications
      meet length and language constraints.\n        -- Item values strictly satisfy
      type and any specified structure/scale/labels constraints.\n        -- The structure
      exactly matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags (no extra keys or commentary).\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"justification\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no items
      to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty
      if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may
      be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be balanced, i.e. cover the key insights with enough detail
      to be informative, while remaining concise.\n        --- Justification should
      be no longer than 3 sentences.\n        --- Justification should be in English.\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n- Private deliberation only:\n    -- Do not output any
      analysis, plan, scratchpad, thoughts, or chain-of-thought.\n    -- Only output

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred

      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT
      (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:

      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.\n    - Each paragraph
      is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\n    -
      You may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    - Each concept is identified
      by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id>
      tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraph_ids\". If the concept is not addressed or there are
      no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only
      leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraph_ids:
      Mandatory field holding the IDs of the document paragraphs based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Ensure such paragraphs directly tie the
      extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:

      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine

      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --

      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance

      this internal three-stage process:\n\n1. Plan\n    - Internally restate each
      concept in one sentence.\n    - List 3-5 concrete lexical/semantic cues for
      relevance aligned with the concept description (include indicators of definition,
      obligation, permission, exception, conditionals, and negations).\n    - If a
      concept specifies a structure, rating scale, or available labels, align inclusion/exclusion
      criteria with those constraints.\n    - For each concept, plan how to synthesize
      the output value from the available evidence even when no literal span is present.\n\n2.
      Evidence triage\n    - Evaluate the provided content holistically; derive candidate
      extractions/values for the concepts (explicit or inferred from context).\n    -
      Collect minimal sufficient evidence privately and note negated, hypothetical,
      or conditional forms.\n    - Prefer precision over recall; include only high-confidence
      items and omit weak or ambiguous ones.\n\n3. Consistency pass\n    - Ensure
      all extracted items strictly match required types and any specified structure,
      rating scales, or label constraints.\n\nNever disclose any plan, evidence, or

      concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The
      item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n    - Treat negations,
      exceptions, and conditionals carefully: relevance may involve permissions, prohibitions,
      requirements, exceptions, thresholds, or ranges; reflect the stance .\n    -
      Prefer minimal sufficient evidence and value derivation:\n    - Favor precision
      over recall; when uncertain, avoid speculative extractions or derivations.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n    -
      Internally verify before finalizing:\n        -- Each provided concept appears
      once, in order, with the correct \"concept_id\".\n        -- The top-level structure
      matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n        --
      Item values strictly satisfy type and any specified structure/scale/labels constraints.\n        --
      The structure exactly matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags (no extra keys or commentary).\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n- Private deliberation only:\n    -- Do not output any

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>","role":"user"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<private_reasoning>\nUse
      private deliberation to plan, evaluate evidence, and verify decisions. Do not
      reveal any intermediate analysis, notes, or steps. Only output the JSON according
      to the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n\nFollow
      this internal three-stage process:\n\n1. Plan\n    - Internally restate each
      concept in one sentence.\n    - List 3-5 concrete lexical/semantic cues for
      relevance aligned with the concept description (include indicators of definition,
      obligation, permission, exception, conditionals, and negations).\n    - If a
      concept specifies a structure, rating scale, or available labels, align inclusion/exclusion
      criteria with those constraints.\n    - For each concept, plan how to synthesize
      the output value from the available evidence even when no literal span is present.\n\n2.
      Evidence triage\n    - Evaluate the provided content holistically; derive candidate
      extractions/values for the concepts (explicit or inferred from context).\n    -
      Collect minimal sufficient evidence privately and note negated, hypothetical,
      or conditional forms.\n    - Prefer precision over recall; include only high-confidence
      items and omit weak or ambiguous ones.\n\n3. Consistency pass\n    - Ensure
      all extracted items strictly match required types and any specified structure,
      rating scales, or label constraints.\n    - Ensure justifications align with
      the item''s evidence and stance, and comply with length and language constraints.\n\nNever
      disclose any plan, evidence, or internal notes - only the JSON array defined
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n</private_reasoning>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n    -
      Treat negations, exceptions, and conditionals carefully: relevance may involve
      permissions, prohibitions, requirements, exceptions, thresholds, or ranges;
      reflect the stance  in the justification.\n    - Prefer minimal sufficient evidence
      and value derivation:\n    - Favor precision over recall; when uncertain, avoid
      speculative extractions or derivations.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing
      your extracted data, in the provided format.\n    - Internally verify before
      finalizing:\n        -- Each provided concept appears once, in order, with the
      correct \"concept_id\".\n        -- The top-level structure matches the format
      specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n        -- No structural
      IDs (concept/paragraph IDs) appear inside justifications.\n        -- Justifications
      meet length and language constraints.\n        -- Item values strictly satisfy
      type and any specified structure/scale/labels constraints.\n        -- The structure
      exactly matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags (no extra keys or commentary).\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"justification\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no items
      to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty
      if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may
      be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be balanced, i.e. cover the key insights with enough detail
      to be informative, while remaining concise.\n        --- Justification should
      be no longer than 3 sentences.\n        --- Justification should be in English.\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include the paragraph''s ID and provide
      a justification, detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\n    -
      If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s
      list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        --
      paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates
      to the aspect. Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The
      provided paragraph ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect''s
      defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as aspect IDs like \"A0\", or paragraph IDs like \"P0\") in the
      justification.\n                ---- Justification should be balanced, i.e.
      cover the key insights with enough detail to be informative, while remaining
      concise.\n                ---- Justification should be no longer than 4 sentences.\n                ----
      Justification should be in English.\n        -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraphs array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional text:\n    --

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"<introduction>\nYou will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\": str,\n        \"paragraph_ids:

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents

      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted

      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED

      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining

      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,

      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow

      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you

      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>

      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a

      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>

      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to

      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for

      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --

      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 1 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required

      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow

      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified

      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be balanced, i.e. cover the key insights with enough detail
      to be informative, while remaining concise.\n        --- Justification should
      be no longer than 3 sentences.\n        --- Justification should be in English.\n    --
      reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph based on which
      the item was extracted for the concept. Each object should include:\n        ---
      reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference
      paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph
      (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory
      field holding an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph,
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must
      match exactly the provided ID for the sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\",
      etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n- Types
      of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item type\"
      within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that the value
      of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual

      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific

      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n

      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific

      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,

      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED

      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be comprehensive, i.e. deliver an in-depth explanation
      that thoroughly details the rationale and supporting evidence.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 10 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

        indicating a serious malfunction. The product is covered by a 5-year warranty,
        which the customer references, confirming warranty applicability. The severity
        is high because the device became unusable very quickly, and the customer
        expresses disappointment given the premium price and her long-term loyalty.
        She has been a loyal customer for over 7 years and has purchased several appliances,
        which supports the ''loyal'' status. The customer requests either a replacement
        or a full refund, but since she lists replacement first, it is the recommended
        resolution. The priority is high due to the urgency expressed and the lack
        of resolution in initial customer service interactions. The expected business
        impact is significant, as the complaint comes from a loyal customer and concerns
        a premium product, which could affect reputation and future sales.\",\n                \"reference_paragraphs\":

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"justification\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no items
      to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty
      if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may
      be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be comprehensive, i.e. deliver an in-depth explanation
      that thoroughly details the rationale and supporting evidence.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 10 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT
      (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT
      (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:
      [\n            ...\n        ],\n    },\n    ...\n]\n</answer_format>\n\n<concepts>\nCONCEPTS:\n<concept

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.\n    - Each paragraph
      is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\n    -
      You may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    - Each concept is identified
      by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id>
      tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraph_ids\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be comprehensive, i.e. deliver an in-depth explanation
      that thoroughly details the rationale and supporting evidence.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 5 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraph_ids: Mandatory field holding
      the IDs of the document paragraphs based on which the item was extracted for
      the concept. Ensure such paragraphs directly tie the extracted item to the concept''s
      defining features. Each paragraph ID must match exactly the provided ID for
      the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>","role":"user"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<private_reasoning>\nUse
      private deliberation to plan, evaluate evidence, and verify decisions. Do not
      reveal any intermediate analysis, notes, or steps. Only output the JSON according
      to the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n\nFollow
      this internal three-stage process:\n\n1. Plan\n    - Internally restate each
      concept in one sentence.\n    - List 3-5 concrete lexical/semantic cues for
      relevance aligned with the concept description (include indicators of definition,
      obligation, permission, exception, conditionals, and negations).\n    - If a
      concept specifies a structure, rating scale, or available labels, align inclusion/exclusion
      criteria with those constraints.\n    - For each concept, plan how to synthesize
      the output value from the available evidence even when no literal span is present.\n\n2.
      Evidence triage\n    - Evaluate the provided content at paragraph level; derive
      candidate extractions/values for the concepts (explicit or inferred from context).\n    -
      Collect minimal sufficient evidence privately and note negated, hypothetical,
      or conditional forms.\n    - Prefer precision over recall; include only high-confidence
      items and omit weak or ambiguous ones.\n\n3. Consistency pass\n    - Ensure
      all extracted items strictly match required types and any specified structure,
      rating scales, or label constraints.\n    - Deduplicate referenced paragraph
      IDs and preserve their original order.\n    - Ensure justifications align with
      the item''s evidence and stance, and comply with length and language constraints.\n\nNever
      disclose any plan, evidence, or internal notes - only the JSON array defined
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n</private_reasoning>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.\n    - Each paragraph
      is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\n    -
      You may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    - Each concept is identified
      by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id>
      tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n    -
      Apply cross-paragraph reasoning when helpful (e.g., headings, lists, references
      like \"above\", \"this section\"): use surrounding context to disambiguate;
      if unresolved, omit.\n    - Treat negations, exceptions, and conditionals carefully:
      relevance may involve permissions, prohibitions, requirements, exceptions, thresholds,
      or ranges; reflect the stance  in the justification.\n    - Prefer minimal sufficient
      evidence and value derivation:\n        -- include only the paragraphs necessary
      to support the item or derived value; avoid tangential mentions.\n    - Favor
      precision over recall; when uncertain, avoid speculative extractions or derivations.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n    -
      Internally verify before finalizing:\n        -- Each provided concept appears
      once, in order, with the correct \"concept_id\".\n        -- The top-level structure
      matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n        --
      When present, \"reference_paragraph_ids\" contain only valid paragraph IDs.\n        --
      No structural IDs (concept/paragraph IDs) appear inside justifications.\n        --
      Justifications meet length and language constraints.\n        -- Item values
      strictly satisfy type and any specified structure/scale/labels constraints.\n        --
      The structure exactly matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags (no extra keys or commentary).\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraph_ids\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be comprehensive, i.e. deliver an in-depth explanation
      that thoroughly details the rationale and supporting evidence.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 4 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraph_ids: Mandatory field holding
      the IDs of the document paragraphs based on which the item was extracted for
      the concept. Ensure such paragraphs directly tie the extracted item to the concept''s
      defining features. Each paragraph ID must match exactly the provided ID for
      the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other

      analysis, plan, scratchpad, thoughts, or chain-of-thought.\n    -- Only output

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-

      Review: Bella Cucina\\n\\nAtmosphere: The restaurant has a warm, inviting ambiance
      with soft lighting and comfortable seating. The d\xE9cor is elegant without
      being pretentious, and the noise level allows for easy conversation.\\n\\nFood
      Quality: The ingredients were fresh and high-quality. The pasta was perfectly
      cooked al dente, and the sauces were flavorful and well-balanced. The seafood
      dish had slightly overcooked shrimp, but the fish was excellent.\\n\\nService:
      Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. Water glasses were
      kept filled, and plates were cleared promptly. However, there was a noticeable
      delay between appetizers and main courses.\\n\\nValue: Portion sizes were generous
      for the price point. The wine list offers selections at various price points,
      though markup is slightly higher than average for comparable restaurants in
      the area.\\n</document_text>\\n\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-4.1\",\"max_tokens\":4096,\"stream\":false,\"temperature\":0.3,\"top_p\":0.3}"

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"justification\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no items
      to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty
      if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may
      be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be balanced, i.e. cover the key insights with enough detail
      to be informative, while remaining concise.\n        --- Justification should
      be no longer than 5 sentences.\n        --- Justification should be in English.\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be comprehensive, i.e. deliver an in-depth explanation
      that thoroughly details the rationale and supporting evidence.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 5 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be balanced, i.e. cover the key insights with enough detail
      to be informative, while remaining concise.\n        --- Justification should
      be no longer than 3 sentences.\n        --- Justification should be in English.\n    --
      reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph based on which
      the item was extracted for the concept. Each object should include:\n        ---
      reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference
      paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph
      (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory
      field holding an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph,
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must

      etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n- Types
      of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item type\"
      within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that the value
      of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining

      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER

      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a

      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:

      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether

      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>

      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---

      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content

      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"justification\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no items
      to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty
      if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may
      be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that
      address or relate to the aspect.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- sentences: An array of objects for
      each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n                ----
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine

      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,

      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that
      address or relate to the aspect.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- sentences: An array of objects for
      each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n                ----
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed or there are no
      items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted items
      may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied
      or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each object should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id:
      Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph
      ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\",
      \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding
      an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on
      which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.\n    - Each paragraph
      is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\n    -
      You may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    - Each concept is identified
      by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id>
      tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\"
      and \"reference_paragraph_ids\". If the concept is not addressed or there are
      no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only
      leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- reference_paragraph_ids:
      Mandatory field holding the IDs of the document paragraphs based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Ensure such paragraphs directly tie the
      extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,

      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<introduction>\nBelow

      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Examine the attached image(s).\n2. Identify whether each concept
      in the concepts list is addressed within the image(s).\n    - Each concept is
      identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified within
      <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a concept
      name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a concept description
      specified within <concept_description></concept_description> tags.\n3. For each
      concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The
      item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON
      array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the image(s), you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the image
      content (either explicitly shown or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the image content allows you to
      determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected visual elements
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the image
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the image does not contain enough
      information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values from the image(s) that contain text,
      translate them in English if the original language of the image(s) is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,

      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,

      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific

      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks

      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-

      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n

      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n

      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text

      Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table
      cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance (e.g.,
      styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,

      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n    - Note that the
      document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements
      such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that

      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"justification\\\".
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\\n-
      Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\\n        --- If
      a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n
      \           ---- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept's defining features. Never reference the concept's ID or
      any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs like
      \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\") in the justification.\\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n
      \       --- Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n        ---
      Justification should be in English.\\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-

      Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)\\n\\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \\\"Agreement\\\")
      is made and entered into as of July 16, 2024, by and between:\\n\\nParty A:\\n\\n_____\\n\\n_____\\n\\n_____\\n\\nContact:

      (012) 345-6789\\n\\nEmail: jane.doe@example.com\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose
      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
      as of the date first above written.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nBy: ___________________________\\n\\nName:

      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the
      aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it
      with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\": str,\n        \"paragraph_ids:

      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --

      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
