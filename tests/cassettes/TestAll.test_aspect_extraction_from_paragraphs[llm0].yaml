      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\",
      \\\"P0-S1\\\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear
      in the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may
      influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      A sentence within the paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n
      \   - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name
      and description), include the paragraph's ID and the IDs of all the sentences
      within the paragraph that address or relate to the aspect.\\n    - If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- sentences:
      An array of objects for each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object
      should include:\\n                ---- sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence,
      e.g., \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\".\\n        -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do
      not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond
      the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n- No additional
      text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\",
      \\\"P0-S1\\\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear
      in the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may
      influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      A sentence within the paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n
      \   - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name
      and description), include the paragraph's ID and the IDs of all the sentences
      within the paragraph that address or relate to the aspect.\\n    - If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- sentences:
      An array of objects for each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object
      should include:\\n                ---- sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence,
      e.g., \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\".\\n        -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do
      not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond
      the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n- No additional

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document;
      therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular
      paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document
      fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from
      the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or
      none of the aspects.\\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect's name and description), include the paragraph's ID and provide
      a justification, detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\\n    -
      If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's
      list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect's defining

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that
      address or relate to the aspect.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- sentences: An array of objects for
      each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n                ----
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.

      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that
      address or relate to the aspect.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- sentences: An array of objects for
      each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n                ----
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that
      address or relate to the aspect.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- sentences: An array of objects for
      each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n                ----
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll

      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\",
      \\\"P0-S1\\\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear
      in the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may
      influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      A sentence within the paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n
      \   - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name
      and description), include the paragraph's ID and the IDs of all the sentences
      within the paragraph that address or relate to the aspect.\\n    - If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- sentences:
      An array of objects for each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object
      should include:\\n                ---- sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence,
      e.g., \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\".\\n        -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n

      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required

      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\",
      \\\"P0-S1\\\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear
      in the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may
      influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      A sentence within the paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n
      \   - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name
      and description), include the paragraph's ID and the IDs of all the sentences
      within the paragraph that address or relate to the aspect.\\n    - If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- sentences:
      An array of objects for each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object
      should include:\\n                ---- sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence,
      e.g., \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\".\\n        -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do
      not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond
      the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that
      address or relate to the aspect.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- sentences: An array of objects for
      each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n                ----
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that
      address or relate to the aspect.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- sentences: An array of objects for
      each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n                ----
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field

      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified

      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include the paragraph''s ID and provide
      a justification, detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\n    -

      provided paragraph ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect''s
      defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as aspect IDs like \"A0\", or paragraph IDs like \"P0\") in the

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and its sentences\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.)
      specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\",
      etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text> tags.\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - A sentence within the paragraph
      can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly
      relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description), include
      the paragraph''s ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that
      address or relate to the aspect.\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\n    -
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- sentences: An array of objects for
      each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n                ----
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include the paragraph''s ID and provide
      a justification, detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\n    -
      If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s
      list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        --
      paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates
      to the aspect. Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The
      provided paragraph ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect''s
      defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as aspect IDs like \"A0\", or paragraph IDs like \"P0\") in the
      justification.\n                ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\n                ---- Justification should be no
      longer than 2 sentences.\n                ---- Justification should be in English.\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraphs
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document;
      therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular
      paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document
      fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from
      the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or
      none of the aspects.\\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect's name and description), include the paragraph's ID and provide
      a justification, detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\\n    -
      If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's
      list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect's defining
      features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt
      (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\") in the
      justification.\\n                ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n                ---- Justification should be no
      longer than 2 sentences.\\n                ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \       -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an
      empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include the paragraph''s ID and provide
      a justification, detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\n    -
      If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s
      list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        --
      paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates
      to the aspect. Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The
      provided paragraph ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect''s
      defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as aspect IDs like \"A0\", or paragraph IDs like \"P0\") in the
      justification.\n                ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\n                ---- Justification should be no
      longer than 2 sentences.\n                ---- Justification should be in English.\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraphs
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks

      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text, sentence_text,
      additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.) specified within <aspect_id></aspect_id>
      tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name> tags, and
      has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n    - Each paragraph is identified
      by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id>
      tags, followed by the full text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text>
      tags.\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in
      the original document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence
      whether a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include the paragraph''s ID and provide
      a justification, detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\n    -
      If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s
      list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n        --
      paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates
      to the aspect. Each object should include:\n            --- paragraph_id: The
      provided paragraph ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect''s
      defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as aspect IDs like \"A0\", or paragraph IDs like \"P0\") in the
      justification.\n                ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\n                ---- Justification should be no
      longer than 2 sentences.\n                ---- Justification should be in English.\n        --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraphs
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n</task_description>\n\n<output_constraints>\n-
      No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks
      or any other formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER
