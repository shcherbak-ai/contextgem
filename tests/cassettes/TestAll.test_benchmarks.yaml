      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document;
      therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular
      paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document
      fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from
      the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or
      none of the aspects.\\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect's name and description), include that paragraph's ID under the
      aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an
      aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final
      answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\\n
      \   - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate
      to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\"].\\n        -- If an aspect has
      no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n-
      Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond
      the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n- No additional
      text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of
      the JSON array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any
      other formatting characters.\\n</output_constraints>\\n\\n<answer_format>\\nANSWER

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nYou
      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required

      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document;
      therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular
      paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document
      fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from
      the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n    - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or
      none of the aspects.\\n    - If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect's name and description), include the paragraph's ID and provide
      a justification, detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\\n    -
      If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's
      list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect's defining
      features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt
      (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\") in the
      justification.\\n                ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n                ---- Justification should be no
      longer than 2 sentences.\\n                ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \       -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an
      empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n

      this Agreement, (b) not disclose it to third parties except to its personnel
      and subcontractors who need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations
      at least as protective, and (c) protect it using reasonable measures.\\n23.3
      Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that is (a)
      publicly available without breach, (b) independently developed without use of
      the Discloser\u2019s information, (c) rightfully received from a third party
      without confidentiality obligations, or (d) approved for release in writing.\\n23.4
      Compelled Disclosure. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the
      extent required by law or court order, provided it uses reasonable efforts to
      provide advance notice to Discloser and cooperates in seeking protective treatment.\\n23.5
      Return/Destruction. Upon request or termination, Recipient will return or destroy
      Confidential Information, except that one archival copy may be retained for
      legal compliance.\\n\\n24. PUBLICITY\\n24.1 Publicity Rights. Neither Party

      Product completed and paid for through the termination date and provide reasonable
      transition assistance at then-current rates.\\n\\n28. FORCE MAJEURE\\n28.1 Neither
      Party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond its reasonable
      control (e.g., acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions,
      failures of suppliers, or widespread outages) provided it uses commercially
      reasonable efforts to mitigate and resumes performance promptly.\\n\\n29. DISPUTE
      RESOLUTION; GOVERNING LAW\\n29.1 Escalation. The Parties will attempt in good
      faith to resolve disputes through executive-level negotiations.\\n29.2 Mediation/Arbitration.

      the other Party\u2019s prior written consent, except to an Affiliate or in connection
      with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided the
      assignee assumes all obligations.\\n31.2 Subcontracting. Developer may subcontract
      portions of the Services but remains responsible for subcontractor performance.\\n\\n32.
      GENERAL\\n32.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all SOWs and
      Exhibits, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior discussions
      and agreements on the subject matter.\\n32.2 Amendments. Any amendment must
      be in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.\\n32.3
      Severability. If any provision is held invalid, the remainder will remain in
      effect, and the Parties will replace the invalid provision with one that most
      closely reflects the original intent.\\n32.4 Waiver. Failure to enforce a provision
      is not a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.\\n32.5
      Counterparts; Electronic Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
      including via electronic signature, each of which is deemed an original.\\n\\n32.6

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nYou
      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After

      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.\\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full
      text of the paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in
      the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\\n    - Each
      concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\"

      distinguish carefully:\\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly
      supported by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n
      \   - Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document
      content allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence
      of expected content that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    -
      Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine
      because either: (1) the document is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the document does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about
      the concept\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    --

      (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"value\\\", \\\"justification\\\",
      and \\\"reference_paragraph_ids\\\". If the concept is not addressed or there
      are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only
      leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\\n        --- Guidance
      regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified
      within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items> tags. Each extracted

      any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs like
      \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\") in the justification.\\n        ---

      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory

      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty

      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content

      transition assistance at then-current rates.\\n\\n28. FORCE MAJEURE\\n28.1 Neither
      Party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond its reasonable
      control (e.g., acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions,
      failures of suppliers, or widespread outages) provided it uses commercially
      reasonable efforts to mitigate and resumes performance promptly.\\n\\n29. DISPUTE

      payment of all amounts due, Developer hereby assigns to Client all right, title,
      and interest in and to the Work Product (excluding Developer Background IP and
      Third-Party Materials), including all Intellectual Property Rights therein.\\n14.2
      Background IP. Each Party retains ownership of its Background IP. To the extent
      Developer Background IP is incorporated into the Work Product, Developer grants
      to Client a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use,
      execute, reproduce, display, perform, and create derivative works of such Background
      IP solely as part of or in connection with the Work Product.\\n14.3 Third-Party

      will invoice monthly in arrears for time-and-materials, and per milestone for
      fixed-price.\\n15.3 Payment Terms. Payments are due within [30] days of invoice
      date. Late amounts accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum
      allowed by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices for fixed-price milestones
      are due within ten (10) days of receipt.\\n15.4 Disputed Amounts. Client may
      withhold payment of disputed amounts with written notice specifying the basis
      for dispute. The Parties will promptly attempt to resolve disputes in good faith.\\n15.5

      VAT, GST, and similar taxes, excluding taxes based on Developer\u2019s income.\\n16.2
      Withholding. If withholding is required by law, Client shall gross up payments
      so Developer receives the full amount invoiced, unless a valid exemption applies.\\n\\n17.
      SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, AND SERVICE LEVELS\\n17.1 Support Tiers. If support is
      included, Developer will provide Tier 1 (end-user triage, FAQ), Tier 2 (application-level

      is provided by Client, Developer, or a third-party platform (e.g., AWS, Azure,
      GCP).\\n19.2 CI/CD and Environments. The Parties will define environments (dev/test/stage/prod),
      branching strategy, and deployment processes. Infrastructure-as-code is preferred
      where applicable.\\n19.3 Monitoring and Logging. Appropriate monitoring, alerting,
      and logging will be implemented as described in Exhibit C and Exhibit D.\\n\\n20.
      WARRANTIES\\n20.1 Performance Warranty. For ninety (90) days after Acceptance,

      it will perform Services in a professional and workmanlike manner.\\n20.3 Virus-Free.
      Developer warrants that, to its knowledge using commercially reasonable scanning
      tools, Deliverables are free from known malicious code at the time of delivery.\\n20.4
      Exclusions. Warranties do not apply to issues caused by (a) modifications not
      made by Developer, (b) misuse or use not in accordance with Documentation, (c)
      third-party systems, or (d) Client\u2019s failure to follow reasonable instructions.\\n20.5
      Remedies. Developer\u2019s sole obligation and Client\u2019s exclusive remedy
      for breach of warranty is repair or replacement of the nonconforming Deliverable,

      INDEMNIFICATION\\n21.1 By Developer. Developer will defend, indemnify, and hold
      harmless Client against third-party claims alleging that the Work Product infringes
      or misappropriates such third party\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights, and
      pay resulting damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees finally awarded
      by a court or agreed in settlement.\\n21.2 Exclusions. Developer has no obligation
      for claims arising from (a) Client content or specifications, (b) combinations
      with items not provided by Developer, (c) modifications not made by Developer,
      or (d) use after Developer provides a non-infringing alternative.\\n21.3 Mitigation.
      If a Deliverable is or is likely to be enjoined, Developer may procure a license,
      modify to be non-infringing, or replace with equivalent functionality. If none
      are commercially reasonable, Developer may terminate the affected SOW and refund
      prepaid fees for the unused portion.\\n21.4 By Client. Client will defend, indemnify,
      and hold harmless Developer against third-party claims arising from Client content,
      data, or instructions provided to Developer that infringe or violate third-party

      liability for IP infringement claims shall be uncapped.\\n\\n22. LIMITATION
      OF LIABILITY\\n22.1 Exclusion of Damages. Except for Excluded Claims, neither
      Party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive,
      or exemplary damages, or for lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or data, even
      if advised of the possibility.\\n22.2 Cap. Except for Excluded Claims, each
      Party\u2019s total aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Agreement
      shall not exceed the total fees paid or payable under the applicable SOW during
      the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to liability.\\n22.3
      Excluded Claims. \\\"Excluded Claims\\\" means (a) a Party\u2019s indemnification
      obligations, (b) a Party\u2019s breach of confidentiality obligations, (c) infringement

      negligence or willful misconduct.\\n\\n23. CONFIDENTIALITY\\n23.1 Definition.
      \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means non-public information disclosed by a
      Party (\\\"Discloser\\\") to the other Party (\\\"Recipient\\\") that is marked

      Obligations. Recipient will (a) use Confidential Information solely to perform
      this Agreement, (b) not disclose it to third parties except to its personnel
      and subcontractors who need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations

      extent required by law or court order, provided it uses reasonable efforts to
      provide advance notice to Discloser and cooperates in seeking protective treatment.\\n23.5
      Return/Destruction. Upon request or termination, Recipient will return or destroy
      Confidential Information, except that one archival copy may be retained for
      legal compliance.\\n\\n24. PUBLICITY\\n24.1 Publicity Rights. Neither Party
      shall issue press releases or public statements referencing the other Party

      Product completed and paid for through the termination date and provide reasonable
      transition assistance at then-current rates.\\n\\n28. FORCE MAJEURE\\n28.1 Neither
      Party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond its reasonable
      control (e.g., acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions,
      failures of suppliers, or widespread outages) provided it uses commercially
      reasonable efforts to mitigate and resumes performance promptly.\\n\\n29. DISPUTE
      RESOLUTION; GOVERNING LAW\\n29.1 Escalation. The Parties will attempt in good
      faith to resolve disputes through executive-level negotiations.\\n29.2 Mediation/Arbitration.

      Background IP. Each Party retains ownership of its Background IP. To the extent
      Developer Background IP is incorporated into the Work Product, Developer grants
      to Client a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use,
      execute, reproduce, display, perform, and create derivative works of such Background
      IP solely as part of or in connection with the Work Product.\\n14.3 Third-Party

      date. Late amounts accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum
      allowed by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices for fixed-price milestones
      are due within ten (10) days of receipt.\\n15.4 Disputed Amounts. Client may
      withhold payment of disputed amounts with written notice specifying the basis
      for dispute. The Parties will promptly attempt to resolve disputes in good faith.\\n15.5

      VAT, GST, and similar taxes, excluding taxes based on Developer\u2019s income.\\n16.2
      Withholding. If withholding is required by law, Client shall gross up payments
      so Developer receives the full amount invoiced, unless a valid exemption applies.\\n\\n17.
      SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, AND SERVICE LEVELS\\n17.1 Support Tiers. If support is
      included, Developer will provide Tier 1 (end-user triage, FAQ), Tier 2 (application-level

      pay resulting damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees finally awarded
      by a court or agreed in settlement.\\n21.2 Exclusions. Developer has no obligation
      for claims arising from (a) Client content or specifications, (b) combinations
      with items not provided by Developer, (c) modifications not made by Developer,
      or (d) use after Developer provides a non-infringing alternative.\\n21.3 Mitigation.
      If a Deliverable is or is likely to be enjoined, Developer may procure a license,
      modify to be non-infringing, or replace with equivalent functionality. If none
      are commercially reasonable, Developer may terminate the affected SOW and refund
      prepaid fees for the unused portion.\\n21.4 By Client. Client will defend, indemnify,
      and hold harmless Developer against third-party claims arising from Client content,
      data, or instructions provided to Developer that infringe or violate third-party

      provide advance notice to Discloser and cooperates in seeking protective treatment.\\n23.5
      Return/Destruction. Upon request or termination, Recipient will return or destroy
      Confidential Information, except that one archival copy may be retained for
      legal compliance.\\n\\n24. PUBLICITY\\n24.1 Publicity Rights. Neither Party

      transition assistance at then-current rates.\\n\\n28. FORCE MAJEURE\\n28.1 Neither
      Party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond its reasonable
      control (e.g., acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions,

      Exclusions. Warranties do not apply to issues caused by (a) modifications not
      made by Developer, (b) misuse or use not in accordance with Documentation, (c)
      third-party systems, or (d) Client\u2019s failure to follow reasonable instructions.\\n20.5
      Remedies. Developer\u2019s sole obligation and Client\u2019s exclusive remedy

      pay resulting damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees finally awarded
      by a court or agreed in settlement.\\n21.2 Exclusions. Developer has no obligation
      for claims arising from (a) Client content or specifications, (b) combinations
      with items not provided by Developer, (c) modifications not made by Developer,

      If a Deliverable is or is likely to be enjoined, Developer may procure a license,
      modify to be non-infringing, or replace with equivalent functionality. If none
      are commercially reasonable, Developer may terminate the affected SOW and refund
      prepaid fees for the unused portion.\\n21.4 By Client. Client will defend, indemnify,
      and hold harmless Developer against third-party claims arising from Client content,
      data, or instructions provided to Developer that infringe or violate third-party

      Confidential Information, except that one archival copy may be retained for
      legal compliance.\\n\\n24. PUBLICITY\\n24.1 Publicity Rights. Neither Party

      compliance obligations.\\n\\n13. OPEN SOURCE AND THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS; AI USE\\n13.1
      OSS Management. Developer may use OSS consistent with Exhibit H. Developer shall
      not include copyleft OSS that would require disclosure of Client proprietary

      and interest in and to the Work Product (excluding Developer Background IP and
      Third-Party Materials), including all Intellectual Property Rights therein.\\n14.2
      Background IP. Each Party retains ownership of its Background IP. To the extent
      Developer Background IP is incorporated into the Work Product, Developer grants
      to Client a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use,
      execute, reproduce, display, perform, and create derivative works of such Background
      IP solely as part of or in connection with the Work Product.\\n14.3 Third-Party
      Materials. Third-Party Materials are subject to their respective license terms.
      Developer will identify such materials and applicable licenses in Exhibit I

      date. Late amounts accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum
      allowed by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices for fixed-price milestones
      are due within ten (10) days of receipt.\\n15.4 Disputed Amounts. Client may
      withhold payment of disputed amounts with written notice specifying the basis
      for dispute. The Parties will promptly attempt to resolve disputes in good faith.\\n15.5

      VAT, GST, and similar taxes, excluding taxes based on Developer\u2019s income.\\n16.2
      Withholding. If withholding is required by law, Client shall gross up payments
      so Developer receives the full amount invoiced, unless a valid exemption applies.\\n\\n17.
      SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, AND SERVICE LEVELS\\n17.1 Support Tiers. If support is
      included, Developer will provide Tier 1 (end-user triage, FAQ), Tier 2 (application-level

      pay resulting damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees finally awarded
      by a court or agreed in settlement.\\n21.2 Exclusions. Developer has no obligation
      for claims arising from (a) Client content or specifications, (b) combinations
      with items not provided by Developer, (c) modifications not made by Developer,

      If a Deliverable is or is likely to be enjoined, Developer may procure a license,
      modify to be non-infringing, or replace with equivalent functionality. If none
      are commercially reasonable, Developer may terminate the affected SOW and refund
      prepaid fees for the unused portion.\\n21.4 By Client. Client will defend, indemnify,
      and hold harmless Developer against third-party claims arising from Client content,
      data, or instructions provided to Developer that infringe or violate third-party

      tools, Deliverables are free from known malicious code at the time of delivery.\\n20.4
      Exclusions. Warranties do not apply to issues caused by (a) modifications not
      made by Developer, (b) misuse or use not in accordance with Documentation, (c)
      third-party systems, or (d) Client\u2019s failure to follow reasonable instructions.\\n20.5
      Remedies. Developer\u2019s sole obligation and Client\u2019s exclusive remedy
      for breach of warranty is repair or replacement of the nonconforming Deliverable,
      or if not feasible, refund of the fees paid for the affected Deliverable.\\n\\n21.
      INDEMNIFICATION\\n21.1 By Developer. Developer will defend, indemnify, and hold
      harmless Client against third-party claims alleging that the Work Product infringes
      or misappropriates such third party\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights, and
      pay resulting damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees finally awarded
      by a court or agreed in settlement.\\n21.2 Exclusions. Developer has no obligation
      for claims arising from (a) Client content or specifications, (b) combinations
      with items not provided by Developer, (c) modifications not made by Developer,
      or (d) use after Developer provides a non-infringing alternative.\\n21.3 Mitigation.
      If a Deliverable is or is likely to be enjoined, Developer may procure a license,
      modify to be non-infringing, or replace with equivalent functionality. If none
      are commercially reasonable, Developer may terminate the affected SOW and refund
      prepaid fees for the unused portion.\\n21.4 By Client. Client will defend, indemnify,
      and hold harmless Developer against third-party claims arising from Client content,
      data, or instructions provided to Developer that infringe or violate third-party
      rights or law.\\n21.5 Procedure. The indemnified Party must promptly notify
      the indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation, and grant control of
      the defense, subject to the right to participate at its own expense.\\n21.6
      Aggregate Cap for IP Claims. Notwithstanding Section 22.2, Developer\u2019s
      liability for IP infringement claims shall be uncapped.\\n\\n22. LIMITATION
      OF LIABILITY\\n22.1 Exclusion of Damages. Except for Excluded Claims, neither
      Party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive,
      or exemplary damages, or for lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or data, even
      if advised of the possibility.\\n22.2 Cap. Except for Excluded Claims, each
      Party\u2019s total aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Agreement
      shall not exceed the total fees paid or payable under the applicable SOW during
      the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to liability.\\n22.3
      Excluded Claims. \\\"Excluded Claims\\\" means (a) a Party\u2019s indemnification

      Confidential Information, except that one archival copy may be retained for
      legal compliance.\\n\\n24. PUBLICITY\\n24.1 Publicity Rights. Neither Party

      Product completed and paid for through the termination date and provide reasonable
      transition assistance at then-current rates.\\n\\n28. FORCE MAJEURE\\n28.1 Neither
      Party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond its reasonable
      control (e.g., acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions,
      failures of suppliers, or widespread outages) provided it uses commercially
      reasonable efforts to mitigate and resumes performance promptly.\\n\\n29. DISPUTE
      RESOLUTION; GOVERNING LAW\\n29.1 Escalation. The Parties will attempt in good
      faith to resolve disputes through executive-level negotiations.\\n29.2 Mediation/Arbitration.

      a court of competent jurisdiction.\\n29.3 Governing Law and Venue. The governing
      law and venue shall be as specified in the SOW, without regard to conflict of
      laws principles and excluding the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International

      effect, and the Parties will replace the invalid provision with one that most
      closely reflects the original intent.\\n32.4 Waiver. Failure to enforce a provision
