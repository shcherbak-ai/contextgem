      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - When
      available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context>
      tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role
      and position within the document. Use this information to:\\n        -- Understand
      document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n        --
      Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table
      cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance (e.g.,
      styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than
      complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content
      without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and
      description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph
      IDs.\\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it
      under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format
      specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\\n    - Your output must
      be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n
      \   - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - When
      available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context>
      tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role
      and position within the document. Use this information to:\\n        -- Understand
      document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n        --
      Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table
      cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance (e.g.,
      styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than
      complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content
      without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and
      description), include the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing
      why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\\n    - If a paragraph does not
      relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce
      the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect's defining
      features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt
      (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\") in the
      justification.\\n                ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n                ---- Justification should be no
      longer than 2 sentences.\\n                ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \       -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an
      empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML

      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - When available, additional context information for paragraphs and
      sentences (such as formatting, list context, or table position) will be provided
      within <additional_context></additional_context> tags, which provides important
      context for understanding their structural role and position within the document.
      Use this information to:\n        -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings
      indicate section boundaries)\n        -- Recognize relationships between content
      (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated data)\n        --
      Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in
      the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    - Each concept
      is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified
      within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a
      concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a concept
      description specified within <concept_description></concept_description> tags.\n3.
      For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n    - Note that the
      document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements
      such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML

      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n

      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value

      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,

      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n

      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if

      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate

      (012) 345-6789\\n\\nEmail: jane.doe@example.com\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose
      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance

      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"justification\\\".
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\\n-
      Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\\n        --- If
      a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n
      \           ---- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept's defining features. Never reference the concept's ID or
      any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs like
      \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\") in the justification.\\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n
      \       --- Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n        ---
      Justification should be in English.\\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>

      (012) 345-6789\\n\\nEmail: jane.doe@example.com\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose
      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
      as of the date first above written.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nBy: ___________________________\\n\\nName:

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining

      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content

      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance

      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - When
      available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context>
      tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role
      and position within the document. Use this information to:\\n        -- Understand
      document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n        --
      Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table
      cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance (e.g.,
      styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than
      complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content
      without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and
      description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph
      IDs.\\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it
      under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format
      specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\\n    - Your output must
      be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n
      \   - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text
      outside of the JSON array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - When
      available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context>
      tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role
      and position within the document. Use this information to:\\n        -- Understand
      document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n        --
      Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table
      cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance (e.g.,
      styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than
      complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content
      without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and
      description), include the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing
      why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\\n    - If a paragraph does not
      relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce
      the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect's defining
      features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt
      (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\") in the
      justification.\\n                ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n                ---- Justification should be no
      longer than 2 sentences.\\n                ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \       -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an
      empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n    - Note that the
      document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements
      such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly

      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n    - Note that the
      document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements
      such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>

      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n    - Note that the
      document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements
      such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nYou
      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"justification\\\".
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\\n-
      Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\\n        --- If
      a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n
      \           ---- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept's defining features. Never reference the concept's ID or
      any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs like
      \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\") in the justification.\\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n
      \       --- Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n        ---
      Justification should be in English.\\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n

      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - When available, additional context information for paragraphs and
      sentences (such as formatting, list context, or table position) will be provided
      within <additional_context></additional_context> tags, which provides important
      context for understanding their structural role and position within the document.
      Use this information to:\n        -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings
      indicate section boundaries)\n        -- Recognize relationships between content
      (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated data)\n        --
      Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in
      the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    - Each concept
      is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified
      within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a
      concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a concept
      description specified within <concept_description></concept_description> tags.\n3.
      For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n

      (012) 345-6789\\n\\nEmail: jane.doe@example.com\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose
      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
      as of the date first above written.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nBy: ___________________________\\n\\nName:

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - When
      available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context>
      tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role
      and position within the document. Use this information to:\\n        -- Understand
      document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n        --
      Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table
      cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance (e.g.,
      styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than
      complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content
      without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and
      description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph
      IDs.\\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty

      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided

      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - When
      available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context>
      tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role
      and position within the document. Use this information to:\\n        -- Understand
      document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n        --
      Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table
      cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance (e.g.,
      styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than
      complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content
      without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and
      description), include the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing
      why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\\n    - If a paragraph does not
      relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce
      the final answer in the JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags\\n    - Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n    - For each aspect (in the order they are provided),
      include:\\n        -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n
      \       -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses
      or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n            --- paragraph_id:
      The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n            --- justification:
      A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect's defining
      features. Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt
      (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\") in the
      justification.\\n                ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n                ---- Justification should be no
      longer than 2 sentences.\\n                ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \       -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an
      empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n    - Note that the
      document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements
      such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll structured
      information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML tags. Field
      names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.) specified within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags.\n    - Each paragraph
      includes sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\",
      \"P0-S1\", etc.) specified within <sentence_id></sentence_id> tags, followed
      by the full text of the sentence specified within <sentence_text></sentence_text>
      tags.\n    - When available, additional context information for paragraphs and
      sentences (such as formatting, list context, or table position) will be provided
      within <additional_context></additional_context> tags, which provides important
      context for understanding their structural role and position within the document.
      Use this information to:\n        -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings
      indicate section boundaries)\n        -- Recognize relationships between content
      (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated data)\n        --
      Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in
      the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n    - Each concept
      is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified
      within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a
      concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a concept
      description specified within <concept_description></concept_description> tags.\n3.
      For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include
      an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.
      However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish
      carefully:\n    - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported
      by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    -
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"value\",
      \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item''s object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        --- The value of \"reference_paragraphs\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \"reference_paragraph_id\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n        --- If a
      specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n            ----
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s ID
      or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>"},{"role":"user","content":"<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n    - Note that the
      document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements
      such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nYou
      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>

      (012) 345-6789\\n\\nEmail: jane.doe@example.com\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose
      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"justification\\\".
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part
      of the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_object_structure>\\n-
      Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item. Must match the exact type specified for the concept.\\n        --- If
      a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale> tags, the extracted item
      value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels> tags, the extracted
      item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. The
      classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n        --- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n
      \           ---- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n        --- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification:
      Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted for the
      concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the extracted
      item to the concept's defining features. Never reference the concept's ID or
      any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs like
      \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\") in the justification.\\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n
      \       --- Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n        ---
      Justification should be in English.\\n</extracted_item_object_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure that
      the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that
      type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float
      for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory
      - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>

      (012) 345-6789\\n\\nEmail: jane.doe@example.com\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose
      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
      as of the date first above written.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nBy: ___________________________\\n\\nName:

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., aspect_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n    - Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.) specified within
      <aspect_id></aspect_id> tags, includes a name specified within <aspect_name></aspect_name>
      tags, and has a description specified within <aspect_description></aspect_description>
      tags.\\n    - Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed
      in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n    - Each paragraph is
      identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.) specified
      within <paragraph_id></paragraph_id> tags, followed by the full text of the
      paragraph specified within <paragraph_text></paragraph_text> tags.\\n    - When
      available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided within <additional_context></additional_context>
      tags, which provides important context for understanding their structural role
      and position within the document. Use this information to:\\n        -- Understand
      document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n        --
      Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related, table
      cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance (e.g.,
      styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than
      complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content
      without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n
      \   - A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n    -
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and
      description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph
      IDs.\\n    - If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it
      under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the JSON format
      specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags\\n    - Your output must
      be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n
      \   - For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n        --
      aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n        -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n        -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, which the parties
      agree represents a reasonable estimate of the damages likely to be suffered

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.

      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n

      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless

      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that
      the document text is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify
      whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>

      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>

      (012) 345-6789\\n\\nEmail: jane.doe@example.com\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose
      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
