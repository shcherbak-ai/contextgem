        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this

        recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License;
        and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating
        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
        part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
        part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
        generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
        notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for

        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate

        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,

        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution

        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide

        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any

        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such

        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES

        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or

        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or

        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty

        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
        part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as

        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names

        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices

        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide

        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works

        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES

        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor

        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While

        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions

        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
        part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
        part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
        generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
        notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You
        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text

        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>\n\n### User:\n<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the

        of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s)

        direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted
        to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date

        copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with
        or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that
        You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other
        recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License;
        and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating
        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
        part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
        part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
        generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
        notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You
        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide

        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this

        recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License;
        and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating
        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
        part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
        part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
        generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
        notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You
        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer

        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,

        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution

        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as

        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any

        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such

        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES

        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or

        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty

        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty

        recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License;
        and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating
        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
        part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as

        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES

        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution

        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide

        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any

        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES

        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor

        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose

        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions

        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,

        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution

        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as

        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works

        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices

        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide

        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works

        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions

        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide,
        non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated
        in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell,
        sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies
        only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are
        necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination
        of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
        was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity
        (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
        the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
        direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted
        to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date
        such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute
        copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with
        or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that
        You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other
        recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License;
        and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating
        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
        part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
        part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
        generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
        notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You
        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this
        License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide,
        non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated
        in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell,
        sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies
        only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are
        necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination
        of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
        was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity
        (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
        the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
        direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted
        to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date
        such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute
        copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with
        or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that
        You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other
        recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License;
        and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating
        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
        part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
        part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
        generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
        notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You
        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n  </deliverable_types>\n</expected_deliverables>\n\n\n<conclusion>\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\n</conclusion>\n\n### User:\n<introduction>\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<private_reasoning>\nUse
      private deliberation to plan, evaluate evidence, and verify decisions. Do not
      reveal any intermediate analysis, notes, or steps. Only output the JSON according
      to the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n\nFollow
      this internal three-stage process:\n\n1. Plan\n    - Internally restate each
      concept in one sentence.\n    - List 3-5 concrete lexical/semantic cues for
      relevance aligned with the concept description (include indicators of definition,
      obligation, permission, exception, conditionals, and negations).\n    - If a
      concept specifies a structure, rating scale, or available labels, align inclusion/exclusion
      criteria with those constraints.\n    - For each concept, plan how to synthesize
      the output value from the available evidence even when no literal span is present.\n\n2.
      Evidence triage\n    - Evaluate the provided content holistically; derive candidate
      extractions/values for the concepts (explicit or inferred from context).\n    -
      Collect minimal sufficient evidence privately and note negated, hypothetical,
      or conditional forms.\n    - Prefer precision over recall; include only high-confidence
      items and omit weak or ambiguous ones.\n\n3. Consistency pass\n    - Ensure
      all extracted items strictly match required types and any specified structure,
      rating scales, or label constraints.\n\nNever disclose any plan, evidence, or
      internal notes - only the JSON array defined within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags.\n</private_reasoning>\n\n<task_description>\nYour task is to:\n1. Read
      through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the
      concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    - Each concept is
      identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.) specified within
      <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described by a concept
      name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a concept description
      specified within <concept_description></concept_description> tags.\n3. For each
      concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The
      item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n    - Treat negations,
      exceptions, and conditionals carefully: relevance may involve permissions, prohibitions,
      requirements, exceptions, thresholds, or ranges; reflect the stance .\n    -
      Prefer minimal sufficient evidence and value derivation:\n    - Favor precision
      over recall; when uncertain, avoid speculative extractions or derivations.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n    -
      Internally verify before finalizing:\n        -- Each provided concept appears
      once, in order, with the correct \"concept_id\".\n        -- The top-level structure
      matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags.\n        --
      Item values strictly satisfy type and any specified structure/scale/labels constraints.\n        --
      The structure exactly matches the format specified within <answer_format></answer_format>
      tags (no extra keys or commentary).\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other

        title from the given document text. The user provided a detailed structure
        for the task, including concepts and document text.\n\nFirst, looking at the
        concept definition for C0: Contract title is the name of the contract. It
        can have zero, one, or multiple extracted items, but in this case, it''s likely
        to be just one since it''s an NDA.\n\nThe document starts with \"Non-Disclosure
        Agreement (NDA)\" as the first line. That seems pretty straightforward. The
        title is clearly stated right at the beginning. \n\nI should make sure that
        I extract exactly that phrase without adding anything else. Since there''s
        only one contract mentioned, the extracted_items array will have a single
        string element.\n\nNo other parts of the document refer to another title or
        mention any additional contracts, so it''s safe to say that \"Non-Disclosure
        Agreement (NDA)\" is the sole contract title here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\":

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\n\n<key_terminology>\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n  <document_definition>\n  1. Document: A structured or unstructured
      file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n    <document_types>\n    - Contracts: Legal
      agreements defining terms and obligations.\n    - Invoices: Financial documents
      detailing transactions and payments.\n    - Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining
      an individual''s professional experience and qualifications.\n    - Visual Documents:
      Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots
      that contain relevant information.\n    - General Documents: Any other types
      of files that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\n    </document_types>\n  \n  Note
      that occasionally you may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger document and should
      be analyzed within their limited context. When working with fragments, focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\n\n    <content_types>\n    Documents may contain textual
      or visual content:\n    - Text-based content: Written information that can be
      directly read and processed.\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n    </content_types>\n  </document_definition>\n\n  <aspect_definition>\n  2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n    <aspect_examples>\n    - Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n    - Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\n    </aspect_examples>\n  You will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n  </aspect_definition>\n\n  <concept_definition>\n  3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n    <concept_types>\n    - Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n    - Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\n    - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications,
      or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n    - Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\n    </concept_types>\n  </concept_definition>\n\n</key_terminology>\n\n<critical_guidelines>\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\n  - Precision and accuracy:
      Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred
      from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the
      document content clearly supports.\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\n\n  <visual_content_analysis>\n  -
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n    -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n    -- Identify and analyze visual patterns,
      relationships, and structural information that may not be explicitly stated
      in text.\n    -- Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important
      semantic information.\n    -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts,
      and diagrams with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n  </visual_content_analysis>\n\n  <contextual_understanding>\n  -
      Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n  </contextual_understanding>\n\n  <systematic_analysis>\n  -
      Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n    -- The nature
      and type of the document\n    -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to
      focus on\n    -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n    --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n  </systematic_analysis>\n\n  <quality_control>\n  -
      Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n    -- All extracted information
      directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n    -- The output format
      matches the required schema exactly\n    -- No extraneous information has been
      included\n    -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n  </quality_control>\n\n  <conservative_approach>\n  -
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n    -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n    --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n    --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n  </conservative_approach>\n\n  <structured_output_compliance>\n  -
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n    -- Modify the
      structure or field names\n    -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n    --
      Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n  </structured_output_compliance>\n\n</critical_guidelines>\n\n<expected_deliverables>\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n  <deliverable_types>\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted

      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\n</introduction>\n\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\n\n<task_description>\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n    -
      Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.)
      specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\n    - Each concept is described
      by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name> tags and a
      concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n</task_description>\n\n<concept_extraction_rules>\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n    -
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n    - Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n    - Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\n    -- Provide your answer in the JSON format specified
      within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format exactly.\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or
      there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts,
      only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</concept_extraction_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_structure>\n- Item structure:\n    --
      All extracted items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\n    --
      If a specific structure is provided for a concept within <expected_structure></expected_structure>
      tags, you must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to
      that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the
      content.\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n        ---
      Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\n</extracted_item_structure>\n\n<type_validation_rules>\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n</type_validation_rules>\n\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        --- Extract
      True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided content
      (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \"extracted_items\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\n    --
      For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple
      labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if multiple items
      are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\n\n<output_constraints>\n- No additional
      text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the
      JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other
      formatting characters.\n</output_constraints>\n\n<answer_format>\nANSWER FORMAT
