      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow

      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant

      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these

      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>

      2016\\n\\non the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing
      of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
      95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\\n\\n(Text with EEA relevance)\\n\\nTHE
      EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\\n\\nHaving regard
      to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article
      16 thereof,\\n\\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\\n\\nAfter
      transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\\n\\nHaving
      regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\\n\\nHaving
      regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\\n\\nActing in accordance
      with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\\n\\nWhereas:\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThe
      protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data
      is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
      the European Union (the \u2018Charter\u2019) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty
      on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the
      right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nThe
      principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to
      the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or
      residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their
      right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute
      to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an
      economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the
      convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being
      of natural persons.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights
      and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure
      the free flow of personal data between Member States.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection
      of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation
      to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights,
      in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects
      all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in
      the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private
      and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom
      of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information,
      freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair
      trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nThe economic
      and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market
      has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The
      exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural
      persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National
      authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate
      and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry
      out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nRapid
      technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for
      the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of
      personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies
      and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale
      in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal
      information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both
      the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of
      personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international
      organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data.\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nThose
      developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in
      the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the
      trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market.
      Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical
      certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should
      be enhanced.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nWhere this Regulation provides for specifications
      or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far
      as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible
      to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into
      their national law.\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nThe objectives and principles of Directive
      95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation
      of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public
      perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons,
      in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection
      of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the
      protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data
      in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the
      Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit
      of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede
      authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such
      a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences
      in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons
      and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the
      level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard
      to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent
      and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal
      data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal
      data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried
      out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
      the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national
      provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation.
      In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing
      Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas
      that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of
      manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing
      of special categories of personal data (\u2018sensitive data\u2019). To that
      extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the
      circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more
      precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nEffective
      protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening
      and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations
      of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well
      as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for
      the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in
      the Member States.\\n\\n(12)\\n\\nArticle 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament
      and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural
      persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating
      to the free movement of personal data.\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nIn order to ensure a consistent
      level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent
      divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal
      market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency
      for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally
      enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and
      processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data,
      and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation
      between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning
      of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within
      the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection
      of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account
      of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this
      Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees
      with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies,
      and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take
      account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in
      the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized
      enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation
      2003/361/EC (5).\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nThe protection afforded by this Regulation should
      apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence,
      in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not
      cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular
      undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of
      the legal person and the contact details of the legal person.\\n\\n(15)\\n\\nIn
      order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of
      natural persons should be technologically neutral and should not depend on the
      techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing
      of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the
      personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system.
      Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured
      according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.\\n\\n(16)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and
      freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall
      outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security.
      This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member
      States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security
      policy of the Union.\\n\\n(17)\\n\\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European
      Parliament and of the Council (6) applies to the processing of personal data
      by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No
      45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal
      data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this Regulation
      and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and
      coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of
      Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should follow after the adoption of this Regulation,
      in order to allow application at the same time as this Regulation.\\n\\n(18)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person
      in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection
      to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or household activities could
      include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and
      online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this
      Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for
      processing personal data for such personal or household activities.\\n\\n(19)\\n\\nThe
      protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
      by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation,
      detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security
      and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal
      act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for
      those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under
      this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more
      specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (7). Member States may entrust competent authorities within
      the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily
      carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or
      prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including
      the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that
      the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is
      within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation.\\n\\nWith
      regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for
      purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able
      to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of
      the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific
      requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities
      for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational
      and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing
      of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation,
      this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific
      conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction
      constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
      safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention,
      investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution
      of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention
      of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework
      of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories.\\n\\n(20)\\n\\nWhile
      this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial
      authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations
      and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by
      courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory authorities
      should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their
      judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in
      the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision-making. It should
      be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific
      bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular
      ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among
      members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle
      complaints in relation to such data processing operations.\\n\\n(21)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of
      the European Parliament and of the Council (8), in particular of the liability
      rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive.
      That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal
      market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between
      Member States.\\n\\n(22)\\n\\nAny processing of personal data in the context
      of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the
      Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of
      whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies
      the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The
      legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with
      a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect.\\n\\n(23)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which
      they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of
      data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established
      in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities
      are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective
      of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller
      or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union,
      it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor
      envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in
      the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or
      an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact
      details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where
      the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention,
      factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or
      more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that
      other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union,
      may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services
      to data subjects in the Union.\\n\\n(24)\\n\\nThe processing of personal data
      of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established
      in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to
      the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour
      takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity
      can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained
      whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent
      use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural
      person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for
      analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\\n\\n(25)\\n\\nWhere
      Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation
      should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a
      Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post.\\n\\n(26)\\n\\nThe principles
      of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified
      or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation,
      which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information
      should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To
      determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken
      of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either
      by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly
      or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to
      identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors,
      such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking
      into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and
      technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore
      not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate
      to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered
      anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.
      This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous
      information, including for statistical or research purposes.\\n\\n(27)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States
      may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased
      persons.\\n\\n(28)\\n\\nThe application of pseudonymisation to personal data
      can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and
      processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction
      of \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 in this Regulation is not intended to preclude
      any other measures of data protection.\\n\\n(29)\\n\\nIn order to create incentives
      to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymisation
      should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller
      when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary
      to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented,
      and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific
      data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data
      should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller.\\n\\n(30)\\n\\nNatural
      persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices,
      applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie
      identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.
      This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers
      and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles
      of the natural persons and identify them.\\n\\n(31)\\n\\nPublic authorities
      to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for
      the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities,
      financial investigation units, independent administrative authorities, or financial
      market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities
      markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which
      are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in
      accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent
      by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional
      and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection
      of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities
      should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes
      of the processing.\\n\\n(32)\\n\\nConsent should be given by a clear affirmative
      act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication
      of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating
      to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means,
      or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet
      website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another
      statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's
      acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence,
      pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent
      should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes.
      When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of
      them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic
      means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to
      the use of the service for which it is provided.\\n\\n(33)\\n\\nIt is often
      not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific
      research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should
      be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when
      in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects
      should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research
      or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose.\\n\\n(34)\\n\\nGenetic
      data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired
      genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of
      a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal,
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the
      analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained.\\n\\n(35)\\n\\nPersonal
      data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status
      of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or
      future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information
      about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or
      the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU
      of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) to that natural person; a
      number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify
      the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing
      or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including from genetic data
      and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability,
      disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical
      state of the data subject independent of its source, for example from a physician
      or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic
      test.\\n\\n(36)\\n\\nThe main establishment of a controller in the Union should
      be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions
      on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another
      establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment
      should be considered to be the main establishment. The main establishment of
      a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria
      and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining
      the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable
      arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of
      personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical
      means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities
      do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not
      determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the
      processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or,
      if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing
      activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and
      the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory
      authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment,
      but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a
      supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate
      in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the
      supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor
      has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities
      concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing
      is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling
      undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of
      undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined
      by another undertaking.\\n\\n(37)\\n\\nA group of undertakings should cover
      a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling
      undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over
      the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation
      or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules
      implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in
      undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings,
      as a group of undertakings.\\n\\n(38)\\n\\nChildren merit specific protection
      with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks,
      consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing
      of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the
      use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality
      or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children
      when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of
      parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive
      or counselling services offered directly to a child.\\n\\n(39)\\n\\nAny processing
      of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural
      persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or
      otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.
      The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication
      relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy
      to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns,
      in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller
      and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and
      transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their
      right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them
      which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules,
      safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how
      to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the
      specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and
      legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data.
      The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
      for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular,
      ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to
      a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the
      processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure
      that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should
      be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every
      reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate
      are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that
      ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including
      for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment
      used for the processing.\\n\\n(40)\\n\\nIn order for processing to be lawful,
      personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject
      concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation
      or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including
      the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data
      subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject
      prior to entering into a contract.\\n\\n(41)\\n\\nWhere this Regulation refers
      to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require
      a legislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements
      pursuant to the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However,
      such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its
      application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with
      the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u2018Court
      of Justice\u2019) and the European Court of Human Rights.\\n\\n(42)\\n\\nWhere
      processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be
      able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing
      operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on another
      matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact
      that and the extent to which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive
      93/13/EEC (10) a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should
      be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain
      language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed,
      the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller
      and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.
      Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine
      or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\\n\\n(43)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid
      legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there
      is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular
      where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that
      consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation.
      Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent
      to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being
      appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including
      the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent
      not being necessary for such performance.\\n\\n(44)\\n\\nProcessing should be
      lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to
      enter into a contract.\\n\\n(45)\\n\\nWhere processing is carried out in accordance
      with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis
      in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law
      for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations
      based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also
      be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore,
      that law could specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the
      lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining
      the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing,
      the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be
      disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to
      ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State
      law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the
      public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public
      authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where
      it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as
      public health and social protection and the management of health care services,
      by private law, such as a professional association.\\n\\n(46)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary
      to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or
      that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital
      interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where
      the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types
      of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital
      interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for
      humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or
      in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural
      and man-made disasters.\\n\\n(47)\\n\\nThe legitimate interests of a controller,
      including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed,
      or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that
      the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are
      not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data
      subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest
      could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship
      between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the
      data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the
      existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether
      a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection
      of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests
      and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the
      interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances
      where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that
      it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities
      to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing
      by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal
      data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes
      a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal
      data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate
      interest.\\n\\n(48)\\n\\nControllers that are part of a group of undertakings
      or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest
      in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal
      administrative purposes, including the processing of clients' or employees'
      personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal data, within
      a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain
      unaffected.\\n\\n(49)\\n\\nThe processing of personal data to the extent strictly
      necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information
      security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist,
      at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions
      that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality
      of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services
      offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities,
      by computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response
      teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and services
      and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate
      interest of the data controller concerned. This could, for example, include
      preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious
      code distribution and stopping \u2018denial of service\u2019 attacks and damage
      to computer and electronic communication systems.\\n\\n(50)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were
      initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible
      with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such
      a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the
      personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance
      of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
      authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine
      and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be
      regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations.
      The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of
      personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order
      to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the
      purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller,
      after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing,
      should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the
      purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal
      data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data
      subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further
      use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further
      processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in
      both the original and intended further processing operations.\\n\\nWhere the
      data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member
      State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic
      society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public
      interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data
      irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application
      of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular the information
      of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including
      the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or
      threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal
      data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act
      or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as
      being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmission
      in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal
      data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal,
      professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.\\n\\n(51)\\n\\nPersonal
      data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental
      rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing
      could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those
      personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,
      whereby the use of the term \u2018racial origin\u2019 in this Regulation does
      not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine
      the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should
      not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal
      data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed
      through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication
      of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing
      is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account
      that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in
      order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance
      with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the
      public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
      In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles
      and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the
      conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for
      processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided,
      inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect
      of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course
      of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose
      of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n(52)\\n\\nDerogating
      from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should
      also be allowed when provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to
      suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights,
      where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal
      data in the field of employment law, social protection law including pensions
      and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control
      of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a derogation
      may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management
      of health-care services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness
      of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the
      health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should
      also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment,
      exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative
      or out-of-court procedure.\\n\\n(53)\\n\\nSpecial categories of personal data
      which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes
      only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons
      and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health
      or social care services and systems, including processing by the management
      and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality
      control, management information and the general national and local supervision
      of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social
      care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes,
      or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has
      to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in
      the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation
      should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories
      of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular
      where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related
      purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union
      or Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as
      to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons.
      Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions,
      including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric
      data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow
      of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border
      processing of such data.\\n\\n(54)\\n\\nThe processing of special categories
      of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas
      of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should
      be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons. In that context, \u2018public health\u2019 should
      be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (11), namely all elements related to health, namely health
      status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect
      on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care,
      the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care
      expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data
      concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal
      data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or
      insurance and banking companies.\\n\\n(55)\\n\\nMoreover, the processing of
      personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims,
      laid down by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially
      recognised religious associations, is carried out on grounds of public interest.\\n\\n(56)\\n\\nWhere
      in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system
      in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's
      political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons
      of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.\\n\\n(57)\\n\\nIf
      the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to
      identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire
      additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose
      of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller
      should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject
      in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. Identification should
      include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication
      mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to
      the on-line service offered by the data controller.\\n\\n(58)\\n\\nThe principle
      of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to
      the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that
      clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation
      be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example,
      when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance
      in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity
      of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether,
      by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being
      collected, such as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit
      specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is
      addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the
      child can easily understand.\\n\\n(59)\\n\\nModalities should be provided for
      facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation,
      including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge,
      in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the
      exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for
      requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed
      by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests
      from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month
      and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any
      such requests.\\n\\n(60)\\n\\nThe principles of fair and transparent processing
      require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing
      operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with
      any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing
      taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal
      data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the
      existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal
      data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed
      whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences,
      where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided
      in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible,
      intelligible and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the intended
      processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be machine-readable.\\n\\n(61)\\n\\nThe
      information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data
      subject should be given to him or her at the time of collection from the data
      subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source, within
      a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal
      data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should
      be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where
      the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than
      that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject
      prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and
      other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be
      provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general
      information should be provided.\\n\\n(62)\\n\\nHowever, it is not necessary
      to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already
      possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal
      data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to
      the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate
      effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried
      out for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of data
      subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should
      be taken into consideration.\\n\\n(63)\\n\\nA data subject should have the right
      of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her,
      and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be
      aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. This includes the right
      for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example
      the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses,
      examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or
      interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to
      know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for
      which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the
      personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic
      involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based
      on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller
      should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide
      the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right
      should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade
      secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting
      the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal
      to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes
      a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller
      should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data
      subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request
      relates.\\n\\n(64)\\n\\nThe controller should use all reasonable measures to
      verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in
      the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not
      retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential
      requests.\\n\\n(65)\\n\\nA data subject should have the right to have personal
      data concerning him or her rectified and a \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019
      where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member
      State law to which the controller is subject. In particular, a data subject
      should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer
      processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
      purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject
      has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data
      concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does
      not otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular
      where the data subject has given his or her consent as a child and is not fully
      aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such
      personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to
      exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child.
      However, the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it
      is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information,
      for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried
      out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
      the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health,
      for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence
      of legal claims.\\n\\n(66)\\n\\nTo strengthen the right to be forgotten in the
      online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way
      that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to
      inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any
      links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In doing so, that
      controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology
      and the means available to the controller, including technical measures, to
      inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subject's
      request.\\n\\n(67)\\n\\nMethods by which to restrict the processing of personal
      data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the selected data to another
      processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or
      temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems,
      the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means
      in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing
      operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data
      is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system.\\n\\n(68)\\n\\nTo further
      strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal
      data is carried out by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed
      to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided
      to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable
      format, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be
      encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. That
      right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the
      basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance
      of a contract. It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground
      other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be
      exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their
      public duties. It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal
      data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data
      subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should
      not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing
      systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal
      data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal
      data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects
      in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice
      the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the
      limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular,
      not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have
      been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent
      that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance
      of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the
      right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to
      another.\\n\\n(69)\\n\\nWhere personal data might lawfully be processed because
      processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
      interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller,
      or on grounds of the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party,
      a data subject should, nevertheless, be entitled to object to the processing
      of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should
      be for the controller to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest
      overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\\n\\n(70)\\n\\nWhere
      personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject
      should have the right to object to such processing, including profiling to the
      extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether with regard to initial
      or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That right should be
      explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly
      and separately from any other information.\\n\\n(71)\\n\\nThe data subject should
      have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure,
      evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on
      automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her
      or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of
      an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention.
      Such processing includes \u2018profiling\u2019 that consists of any form of
      automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating
      to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning
      the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
      preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where
      it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects
      him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling,
      should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to
      which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring
      and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards
      and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to
      ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller,
      or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data
      subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit
      consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards,
      which should include specific information to the data subject and the right
      to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain
      an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge
      the decision. Such measure should not concern a child.\\n\\nIn order to ensure
      fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into
      account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are
      processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical
      procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures
      appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies
      in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal
      data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the
      interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory
      effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political
      opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status
      or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect. Automated
      decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should
      be allowed only under specific conditions.\\n\\n(72)\\n\\nProfiling is subject
      to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such
      as the legal grounds for processing or data protection principles. The European
      Data Protection Board established by this Regulation (the \u2018Board\u2019)
      should be able to issue guidance in that context.\\n\\n(73)\\n\\nRestrictions
      concerning specific principles and the rights of information, access to and
      rectification or erasure of personal data, the right to data portability, the
      right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the communication
      of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations
      of the controllers may be imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessary
      and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard public security, including
      the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade disasters,
      the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution
      of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention
      of threats to public security, or of breaches of ethics for regulated professions,
      other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member
      State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union
      or of a Member State, the keeping of public registers kept for reasons of general
      public interest, further processing of archived personal data to provide specific
      information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state
      regimes or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of
      others, including social protection, public health and humanitarian purposes.
      Those restrictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in
      the Charter and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
      and Fundamental Freedoms.\\n\\n(74)\\n\\nThe responsibility and liability of
      the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller
      or on the controller's behalf should be established. In particular, the controller
      should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able
      to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation,
      including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into
      account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk
      to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(75)\\n\\nThe risk to the
      rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity,
      may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material
      or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to
      discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation,
      loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy,
      unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic
      or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights
      and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data;
      where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin, political
      opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the
      processing of genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life
      or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures; where personal
      aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting aspects concerning
      performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests,
      reliability or behaviour, location or movements, in order to create or use personal
      profiles; where personal data of vulnerable natural persons, in particular of
      children, are processed; or where processing involves a large amount of personal
      data and affects a large number of data subjects.\\n\\n(76)\\n\\nThe likelihood
      and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should
      be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
      processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment,
      by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk
      or a high risk.\\n\\n(77)\\n\\nGuidance on the implementation of appropriate
      measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor,
      especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing,
      their assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the
      identification of best practices to mitigate the risk, could be provided in
      particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications, guidelines
      provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer.
      The Board may also issue guidelines on processing operations that are considered
      to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons and indicate what measures may be sufficient in such cases to address
      such risk.\\n\\n(78)\\n\\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons with regard to the processing of personal data require that appropriate
      technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements
      of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with
      this Regulation, the controller should adopt internal policies and implement
      measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design
      and data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of
      minimising the processing of personal data, pseudonymising personal data as
      soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and processing of
      personal data, enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing, enabling
      the controller to create and improve security features. When developing, designing,
      selecting and using applications, services and products that are based on the
      processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers
      of the products, services and applications should be encouraged to take into
      account the right to data protection when developing and designing such products,
      services and applications and, with due regard to the state of the art, to make
      sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection
      obligations. The principles of data protection by design and by default should
      also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders.\\n\\n(79)\\n\\nThe
      protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility
      and liability of controllers and processors, also in relation to the monitoring
      by and measures of supervisory authorities, requires a clear allocation of the
      responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines
      the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where
      a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller.\\n\\n(80)\\n\\nWhere
      a controller or a processor not established in the Union is processing personal
      data of data subjects who are in the Union whose processing activities are related
      to the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the
      data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union, or to the monitoring
      of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union, the
      controller or the processor should designate a representative, unless the processing
      is occasional, does not include processing, on a large scale, of special categories
      of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions
      and offences, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes
      of the processing or if the controller is a public authority or body. The representative
      should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed
      by any supervisory authority. The representative should be explicitly designated
      by a written mandate of the controller or of the processor to act on its behalf
      with regard to its obligations under this Regulation. The designation of such
      a representative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller
      or of the processor under this Regulation. Such a representative should perform
      its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller or processor,
      including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard
      to any action taken to ensure compliance with this Regulation. The designated
      representative should be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of
      non-compliance by the controller or processor.\\n\\n(81)\\n\\nTo ensure compliance
      with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be
      carried out by the processor on behalf of the controller, when entrusting a
      processor with processing activities, the controller should use only processors
      providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms of expert knowledge,
      reliability and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures
      which will meet the requirements of this Regulation, including for the security
      of processing. The adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct
      or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate
      compliance with the obligations of the controller. The carrying-out of processing
      by a processor should be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union
      or Member State law, binding the processor to the controller, setting out the
      subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the
      processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects, taking
      into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the processor in the
      context of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms
      of the data subject. The controller and processor may choose to use an individual
      contract or standard contractual clauses which are adopted either directly by
      the Commission or by a supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency
      mechanism and then adopted by the Commission. After the completion of the processing
      on behalf of the controller, the processor should, at the choice of the controller,
      return or delete the personal data, unless there is a requirement to store the
      personal data under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject.\\n\\n(82)\\n\\nIn
      order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor
      should maintain records of processing activities under its responsibility. Each
      controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory
      authority and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might
      serve for monitoring those processing operations.\\n\\n(83)\\n\\nIn order to
      maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation,
      the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing
      and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. Those measures
      should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking
      into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation
      to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing
      data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented
      by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
      alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted,
      stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical, material
      or non-material damage.\\n\\n(84)\\n\\nIn order to enhance compliance with this
      Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible
      for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment to evaluate, in
      particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that risk. The
      outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the
      appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing
      of personal data complies with this Regulation. Where a data-protection impact
      assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the
      controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology
      and costs of implementation, a consultation of the supervisory authority should
      take place prior to the processing.\\n\\n(85)\\n\\nA personal data breach may,
      if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material
      or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their
      personal data or limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft
      or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage
      to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional
      secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural
      person concerned. Therefore, as soon as the controller becomes aware that a
      personal data breach has occurred, the controller should notify the personal
      data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible,
      not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the controller
      is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that
      the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons. Where such notification cannot be achieved within 72 hours,
      the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification and information
      may be provided in phases without undue further delay.\\n\\n(86)\\n\\nThe controller
      should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach, without undue
      delay, where that personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to allow him or her to
      take the necessary precautions. The communication should describe the nature
      of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person
      concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects. Such communications to data
      subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation
      with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other
      relevant authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need
      to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication
      with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against
      continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication.\\n\\n(87)\\n\\nIt
      should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational
      measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data
      breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and
      the data subject. The fact that the notification was made without undue delay
      should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity
      of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the
      data subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory
      authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation.\\n\\n(88)\\n\\nIn
      setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the
      notification of personal data breaches, due consideration should be given to
      the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not personal data had
      been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting
      the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules
      and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law-enforcement
      authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation
      of the circumstances of a personal data breach.\\n\\n(89)\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC
      provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data
      to the supervisory authorities. While that obligation produces administrative
      and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection
      of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should
      therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms
      which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely
      to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue
      of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations
      may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or are of
      a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out
      before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the
      time that has elapsed since the initial processing.\\n\\n(90)\\n\\nIn such cases,
      a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller
      prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity
      of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes
      of the processing and the sources of the risk. That impact assessment should
      include, in particular, the measures, safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for
      mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating
      compliance with this Regulation.\\n\\n(91)\\n\\nThis should in particular apply
      to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount
      of personal data at regional, national or supranational level and which could
      affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high
      risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in accordance with
      the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a
      large scale as well as to other processing operations which result in a high
      risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular where those
      operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights.
      A data protection impact assessment should also be made where personal data
      are processed for taking decisions regarding specific natural persons following
      any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural
      persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special
      categories of personal data, biometric data, or data on criminal convictions
      and offences or related security measures. A data protection impact assessment
      is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale,
      especially when using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where
      the competent supervisory authority considers that the processing is likely
      to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular
      because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service
      or a contract, or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale.
      The processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale
      if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual
      physician, other health care professional or lawyer. In such cases, a data protection
      impact assessment should not be mandatory.\\n\\n(92)\\n\\nThere are circumstances
      under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection
      impact assessment to be broader than a single project, for example where public
      authorities or bodies intend to establish a common application or processing
      platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common application
      or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely
      used horizontal activity.\\n\\n(93)\\n\\nIn the context of the adoption of the
      Member State law on which the performance of the tasks of the public authority
      or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation
      or set of operations in question, Member States may deem it necessary to carry
      out such assessment prior to the processing activities.\\n\\n(94)\\n\\nWhere
      a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in
      the absence of safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the
      risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and
      the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable
      means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation, the supervisory
      authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activities. Such
      high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent
      and frequency of processing, which may result also in a realisation of damage
      or interference with the rights and freedoms of the natural person. The supervisory
      authority should respond to the request for consultation within a specified
      period. However, the absence of a reaction of the supervisory authority within
      that period should be without prejudice to any intervention of the supervisory
      authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation,
      including the power to prohibit processing operations. As part of that consultation
      process, the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with
      regard to the processing at issue may be submitted to the supervisory authority,
      in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(95)\\n\\nThe processor should assist the
      controller, where necessary and upon request, in ensuring compliance with the
      obligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments
      and from prior consultation of the supervisory authority.\\n\\n(96)\\n\\nA consultation
      of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation
      of a legislative or regulatory measure which provides for the processing of
      personal data, in order to ensure compliance of the intended processing with
      this Regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data
      subject.\\n\\n(97)\\n\\nWhere the processing is carried out by a public authority,
      except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial
      capacity, where, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller
      whose core activities consist of processing operations that require regular
      and systematic monitoring of the data subjects on a large scale, or where the
      core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on
      a large scale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences, a person with expert knowledge of data protection
      law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor internal
      compliance with this Regulation. In the private sector, the core activities
      of a controller relate to its primary activities and do not relate to the processing
      of personal data as ancillary activities. The necessary level of expert knowledge
      should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations
      carried out and the protection required for the personal data processed by the
      controller or the processor. Such data protection officers, whether or not they
      are an employee of the controller, should be in a position to perform their
      duties and tasks in an independent manner.\\n\\n(98)\\n\\nAssociations or other
      bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged
      to draw up codes of conduct, within the limits of this Regulation, so as to
      facilitate the effective application of this Regulation, taking account of the
      specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and
      the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. In particular, such
      codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors,
      taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights
      and freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(99)\\n\\nWhen drawing up a code of conduct,
      or when amending or extending such a code, associations and other bodies representing
      categories of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders,
      including data subjects where feasible, and have regard to submissions received
      and views expressed in response to such consultations.\\n\\n(100)\\n\\nIn order
      to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment
      of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged,
      allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant
      products and services.\\n\\n(101)\\n\\nFlows of personal data to and from countries
      outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion
      of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in such flows
      has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal
      data. However, when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers,
      processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations,
      the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation
      should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal
      data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors
      in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any event,
      transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried
      out in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only
      if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid
      down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal
      data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by
      the controller or processor.\\n\\n(102)\\n\\nThis Regulation is without prejudice
      to international agreements concluded between the Union and third countries
      regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for
      the data subjects. Member States may conclude international agreements which
      involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations,
      as far as such agreements do not affect this Regulation or any other provisions
      of Union law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental
      rights of the data subjects.\\n\\n(103)\\n\\nThe Commission may decide with
      effect for the entire Union that a third country, a territory or specified sector
      within a third country, or an international organisation, offers an adequate
      level of data protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout
      the Union as regards the third country or international organisation which is
      considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers of
      personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place
      without the need to obtain any further authorisation. The Commission may also
      decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to
      the third country or international organisation, to revoke such a decision.\\n\\n(104)\\n\\nIn
      line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular
      the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its assessment of
      the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third country,
      take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access
      to justice as well as international human rights norms and standards and its
      general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security,
      defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The
      adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector
      in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria, such
      as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards
      and legislation in force in the third country. The third country should offer
      guarantees ensuring an adequate level of protection essentially equivalent to
      that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are processed
      in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the third country should
      ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide
      for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data protection authorities,
      and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights
      and effective administrative and judicial redress.\\n\\n(105)\\n\\nApart from
      the international commitments the third country or international organisation
      has entered into, the Commission should take account of obligations arising
      from the third country's or international organisation's participation in multilateral
      or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal
      data, as well as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the
      third country's accession to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January
      1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing
      of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be taken into account. The
      Commission should consult the Board when assessing the level of protection in
      third countries or international organisations.\\n\\n(106)\\n\\nThe Commission
      should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a
      third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an
      international organisation, and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted
      on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its
      adequacy decisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism
      of their functioning. That periodic review should be conducted in consultation
      with the third country or international organisation in question and take into
      account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation.
      For the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the
      Commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the European
      Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources.
      The Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of
      the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the Committee within
      the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of
      the Council (12) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament
      and to the Council.\\n\\n(107)\\n\\nThe Commission may recognise that a third
      country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international
      organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently
      the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation
      should be prohibited, unless the requirements in this Regulation relating to
      transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules,
      and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision
      should be made for consultations between the Commission and such third countries
      or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely manner, inform
      the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into
      consultations with it in order to remedy the situation.\\n\\n(108)\\n\\nIn the
      absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor should take measures
      to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate
      safeguards for the data subject. Such appropriate safeguards may consist of
      making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted
      by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory
      authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority. Those
      safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the
      rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including
      the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies,
      including to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim
      compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular
      to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing,
      the principles of data protection by design and by default. Transfers may also
      be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies
      in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties
      or functions, including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative
      arrangements, such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable
      and effective rights for data subjects. Authorisation by the competent supervisory
      authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative
      arrangements that are not legally binding.\\n\\n(109)\\n\\nThe possibility for
      the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopted
      by the Commission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or
      processors neither from including the standard data-protection clauses in a
      wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another processor,
      nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do
      not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted
      by the Commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental
      rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors should be
      encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that
      supplement standard protection clauses.\\n\\n(110)\\n\\nA group of undertakings,
      or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, should be able
      to make use of approved binding corporate rules for its international transfers
      from the Union to organisations within the same group of undertakings, or group
      of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, provided that such corporate
      rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate
      safeguards for transfers or categories of transfers of personal data.\\n\\n(111)\\n\\nProvisions
      should be made for the possibility for transfers in certain circumstances where
      the data subject has given his or her explicit consent, where the transfer is
      occasional and necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim, regardless
      of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any out-of-court
      procedure, including procedures before regulatory bodies. Provision should also
      be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds of public
      interest laid down by Union or Member State law so require or where the transfer
      is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by
      the public or persons having a legitimate interest. In the latter case, such
      a transfer should not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories
      of the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for
      consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be
      made only at the request of those persons or, if they are to be the recipients,
      taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject.\\n\\n(112)\\n\\nThose
      derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary
      for important reasons of public interest, for example in cases of international
      data exchange between competition authorities, tax or customs administrations,
      between financial supervisory authorities, between services competent for social
      security matters, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing
      for contagious diseases or in order to reduce and/or eliminate doping in sport.
      A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary
      to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's or another
      person's vital interests, including physical integrity or life, if the data
      subject is incapable of giving consent. In the absence of an adequacy decision,
      Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly
      set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country
      or an international organisation. Member States should notify such provisions
      to the Commission. Any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation
      of personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of
      giving consent, with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva
      Conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law applicable in
      armed conflicts, could be considered to be necessary for an important reason
      of public interest or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject.\\n\\n(113)\\n\\nTransfers
      which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number
      of data subjects, could also be possible for the purposes of the compelling
      legitimate interests pursued by the controller, when those interests are not
      overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when
      the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer.
      The controller should give particular consideration to the nature of the personal
      data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations,
      as well as the situation in the country of origin, the third country and the
      country of final destination, and should provide suitable safeguards to protect
      fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing
      of their personal data. Such transfers should be possible only in residual cases
      where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, the legitimate expectations
      of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into consideration.
      The controller should inform the supervisory authority and the data subject
      about the transfer.\\n\\n(114)\\n\\nIn any case, where the Commission has taken
      no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third country, the
      controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects
      with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing of their data
      in the Union once those data have been transferred so that that they will continue
      to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards.\\n\\n(115)\\n\\nSome third
      countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly
      regulate the processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction
      of the Member States. This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions
      of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor
      to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international
      agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting
      third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application
      of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international
      law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured
      in the Union by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the
      conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This
      may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important
      ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the
      controller is subject.\\n\\n(116)\\n\\nWhen personal data moves across borders
      outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons
      to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from
      the unlawful use or disclosure of that information. At the same time, supervisory
      authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations
      relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together
      in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative
      or remedial powers, inconsistent legal regimes, and practical obstacles like
      resource constraints. Therefore, there is a need to promote closer cooperation
      among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information
      and carry out investigations with their international counterparts. For the
      purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate and
      provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for
      the protection of personal data, the Commission and the supervisory authorities
      should exchange information and cooperate in activities related to the exercise
      of their powers with competent authorities in third countries, based on reciprocity
      and in accordance with this Regulation.\\n\\n(117)\\n\\nThe establishment of
      supervisory authorities in Member States, empowered to perform their tasks and
      exercise their powers with complete independence, is an essential component
      of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their
      personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one supervisory
      authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative
      structure.\\n\\n(118)\\n\\nThe independence of supervisory authorities should
      not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject to control or monitoring
      mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review.\\n\\n(119)\\n\\nWhere
      a Member State establishes several supervisory authorities, it should establish
      by law mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of those supervisory
      authorities in the consistency mechanism. That Member State should in particular
      designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point
      for the effective participation of those authorities in the mechanism, to ensure
      swift and smooth cooperation with other supervisory authorities, the Board and
      the Commission.\\n\\n(120)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority should be provided
      with the financial and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary
      for the effective performance of their tasks, including those related to mutual
      assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the
      Union. Each supervisory authority should have a separate, public annual budget,
      which may be part of the overall state or national budget.\\n\\n(121)\\n\\nThe
      general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority should
      be laid down by law in each Member State and should in particular provide that
      those members are to be appointed, by means of a transparent procedure, either
      by the parliament, government or the head of State of the Member State on the
      basis of a proposal from the government, a member of the government, the parliament
      or a chamber of the parliament, or by an independent body entrusted under Member
      State law. In order to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority,
      the member or members should act with integrity, refrain from any action that
      is incompatible with their duties and should not, during their term of office,
      engage in any incompatible occupation, whether gainful or not. The supervisory
      authority should have its own staff, chosen by the supervisory authority or
      an independent body established by Member State law, which should be subject
      to the exclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority.\\n\\n(122)\\n\\nEach
      supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own Member
      State to exercise the powers and to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance
      with this Regulation. This should cover in particular the processing in the
      context of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor
      on the territory of its own Member State, the processing of personal data carried
      out by public authorities or private bodies acting in the public interest, processing
      affecting data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller
      or processor not established in the Union when targeting data subjects residing
      on its territory. This should include handling complaints lodged by a data subject,
      conducting investigations on the application of this Regulation and promoting
      public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the
      processing of personal data.\\n\\n(123)\\n\\nThe supervisory authorities should
      monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and contribute
      to its consistent application throughout the Union, in order to protect natural
      persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate
      the free flow of personal data within the internal market. For that purpose,
      the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the Commission,
      without the need for any agreement between Member States on the provision of
      mutual assistance or on such cooperation.\\n\\n(124)\\n\\nWhere the processing
      of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment
      of a controller or a processor in the Union and the controller or processor
      is established in more than one Member State, or where processing taking place
      in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or
      processor in the Union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect
      data subjects in more than one Member State, the supervisory authority for the
      main establishment of the controller or processor or for the single establishment
      of the controller or processor should act as lead authority. It should cooperate
      with the other authorities concerned, because the controller or processor has
      an establishment on the territory of their Member State, because data subjects
      residing on their territory are substantially affected, or because a complaint
      has been lodged with them. Also where a data subject not residing in that Member
      State has lodged a complaint, the supervisory authority with which such complaint
      has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority concerned. Within its
      tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this Regulation,
      the Board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to
      be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the processing in question
      substantially affects data subjects in more than one Member State and on what
      constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection.\\n\\n(125)\\n\\nThe lead authority
      should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the
      powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. In its capacity as
      lead authority, the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate
      the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process. Where
      the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part,
      that decision should be adopted by the supervisory authority with which the
      complaint has been lodged.\\n\\n(126)\\n\\nThe decision should be agreed jointly
      by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned
      and should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller
      or processor and be binding on the controller and processor. The controller
      or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this
      Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory
      authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards
      the processing activities in the Union.\\n\\n(127)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority
      not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local
      cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member
      State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing
      carried out in a single Member State and involves only data subjects in that
      single Member State, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing
      of employees' personal data in the specific employment context of a Member State.
      In such cases, the supervisory authority should inform the lead supervisory
      authority without delay about the matter. After being informed, the lead supervisory
      authority should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision
      on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory
      authorities concerned (\u2018one-stop-shop mechanism\u2019), or whether the
      supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level.
      When deciding whether it will handle the case, the lead supervisory authority
      should take into account whether there is an establishment of the controller
      or processor in the Member State of the supervisory authority which informed
      it in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-\xE0-vis the controller
      or processor. Where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case,
      the supervisory authority which informed it should have the possibility to submit
      a draft for a decision, of which the lead supervisory authority should take
      utmost account when preparing its draft decision in that one-stop-shop mechanism.\\n\\n(128)\\n\\nThe
      rules on the lead supervisory authority and the one-stop-shop mechanism should
      not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities or private
      bodies in the public interest. In such cases the only supervisory authority
      competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this Regulation
      should be the supervisory authority of the Member State where the public authority
      or private body is established.\\n\\n(129)\\n\\nIn order to ensure consistent
      monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory
      authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers,
      including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and authorisation
      and advisory powers, in particular in cases of complaints from natural persons,
      and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under Member
      State law, to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the
      judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings. Such powers should also
      include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation, including
      a ban, on processing. Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection
      of personal data under this Regulation. The powers of supervisory authorities
      should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set
      out in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable
      time. In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate
      in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the
      circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person to
      be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely
      is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons
      concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised
      in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such
      as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding
      measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous,
      indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure, the date of
      issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of the supervisory
      authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer
      to the right of an effective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements
      pursuant to Member State procedural law. The adoption of a legally binding decision
      implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the
      supervisory authority that adopted the decision.\\n\\n(130)\\n\\nWhere the supervisory
      authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory
      authority, the lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the
      supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged in accordance
      with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this Regulation.
      In such cases, the lead supervisory authority should, when taking measures intended
      to produce legal effects, including the imposition of administrative fines,
      take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority with which the
      complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any
      investigation on the territory of its own Member State in liaison with the competent
      supervisory authority.\\n\\n(131)\\n\\nWhere another supervisory authority should
      act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of the controller
      or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible
      infringement concerns only processing activities of the controller or processor
      in the Member State where the complaint has been lodged or the possible infringement
      detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to substantially
      affect data subjects in other Member States, the supervisory authority receiving
      a complaint or detecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail
      possible infringements of this Regulation should seek an amicable settlement
      with the controller and, if this proves unsuccessful, exercise its full range
      of powers. This should include: specific processing carried out in the territory
      of the Member State of the supervisory authority or with regard to data subjects
      on the territory of that Member State; processing that is carried out in the
      context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects
      in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority; or processing
      that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal obligations under
      Member State law.\\n\\n(132)\\n\\nAwareness-raising activities by supervisory
      authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures directed
      at controllers and processors, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      as well as natural persons in particular in the educational context.\\n\\n(133)\\n\\nThe
      supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and
      provide mutual assistance, so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement
      of this Regulation in the internal market. A supervisory authority requesting
      mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response
      to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request
      by the other supervisory authority.\\n\\n(134)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority
      should, where appropriate, participate in joint operations with other supervisory
      authorities. The requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond
      to the request within a specified time period.\\n\\n(135)\\n\\nIn order to ensure
      the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency
      mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established.
      That mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends
      to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations
      which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several
      Member States. It should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned
      or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency
      mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the
      Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties.\\n\\n(136)\\n\\nIn
      applying the consistency mechanism, the Board should, within a determined period
      of time, issue an opinion, if a majority of its members so decides or if so
      requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission. The Board
      should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are
      disputes between supervisory authorities. For that purpose, it should issue,
      in principle by a two-thirds majority of its members, legally binding decisions
      in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory
      authorities, in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory
      authority and supervisory authorities concerned on the merits of the case, in
      particular whether there is an infringement of this Regulation.\\n\\n(137)\\n\\nThere
      may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of
      data subjects, in particular when the danger exists that the enforcement of
      a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded. A supervisory authority
      should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its
      territory with a specified period of validity which should not exceed three
      months.\\n\\n(138)\\n\\nThe application of such mechanism should be a condition
      for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce legal effects by a supervisory
      authority in those cases where its application is mandatory. In other cases
      of cross-border relevance, the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory
      authority and supervisory authorities concerned should be applied and mutual
      assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the supervisory
      authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering
      the consistency mechanism.\\n\\n(139)\\n\\nIn order to promote the consistent
      application of this Regulation, the Board should be set up as an independent
      body of the Union. To fulfil its objectives, the Board should have legal personality.
      The Board should be represented by its Chair. It should replace the Working
      Party on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal
      Data established by Directive 95/46/EC. It should consist of the head of a supervisory
      authority of each Member State and the European Data Protection Supervisor or
      their respective representatives. The Commission should participate in the Board's
      activities without voting rights and the European Data Protection Supervisor
      should have specific voting rights. The Board should contribute to the consistent
      application of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by advising the
      Commission, in particular on the level of protection in third countries or international
      organisations, and promoting cooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout
      the Union. The Board should act independently when performing its tasks.\\n\\n(140)\\n\\nThe
      Board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the European Data Protection
      Supervisor. The staff of the European Data Protection Supervisor involved in
      carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this Regulation should perform
      its tasks exclusively under the instructions of, and report to, the Chair of
      the Board.\\n\\n(141)\\n\\nEvery data subject should have the right to lodge
      a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in the Member
      State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial
      remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter if the data subject considers
      that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed or where the supervisory
      authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses
      a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights
      of the data subject. The investigation following a complaint should be carried
      out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific
      case. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress
      and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires
      further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate
      information should be given to the data subject. In order to facilitate the
      submission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such
      as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically,
      without excluding other means of communication.\\n\\n(142)\\n\\nWhere a data
      subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed,
      he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation
      or association which is constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State,
      has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the
      field of the protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her
      behalf with a supervisory authority, exercise the right to a judicial remedy
      on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise
      the right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State
      may provide for such a body, organisation or association to have the right to
      lodge a complaint in that Member State, independently of a data subject's mandate,
      and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider
      that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing
      of personal data which infringes this Regulation. That body, organisation or
      association may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subject's behalf
      independently of the data subject's mandate.\\n\\n(143)\\n\\nAny natural or
      legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of
      the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article
      263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities concerned
      which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being
      notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the
      Board are of direct and individual concern to a controller, processor or complainant,
      the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within
      two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with
      Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each
      natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the
      competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which
      produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular
      the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory
      authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to
      an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory
      authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice
      provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority
      should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory
      authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member
      State's procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which
      should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant
      to the dispute before them.\\n\\nWhere a complaint has been rejected or dismissed
      by a supervisory authority, the complainant may bring proceedings before the
      courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating
      to the application of this Regulation, national courts which consider a decision
      on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment, may, or in the case
      provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the Court of Justice to give
      a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including this Regulation.
      Furthermore, where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision
      of the Board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision
      of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare
      the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the
      Court of Justice in accordance with Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court
      of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a national court
      may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the
      request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action
      for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was directly and individually
      concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down
      in Article 263 TFEU.\\n\\n(144)\\n\\nWhere a court seized of proceedings against
      a decision by a supervisory authority has reason to believe that proceedings
      concerning the same processing, such as the same subject matter as regards processing
      by the same controller or processor, or the same cause of action, are brought
      before a competent court in another Member State, it should contact that court
      in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings. If related proceedings
      are pending before a court in another Member State, any court other than the
      court first seized may stay its proceedings or may, on request of one of the
      parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seized if that court
      has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consolidation
      of such related proceedings. Proceedings are deemed to be related where they
      are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together
      in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate
      proceedings.\\n\\n(145)\\n\\nFor proceedings against a controller or processor,
      the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before the courts of
      the Member States where the controller or processor has an establishment or
      where the data subject resides, unless the controller is a public authority
      of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.\\n\\n(146)\\n\\nThe
      controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer
      as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or
      processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any
      way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted
      in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully
      reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any
      claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member
      State law. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing
      that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this
      Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data subjects
      should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered.
      Where controllers or processors are involved in the same processing, each controller
      or processor should be held liable for the entire damage. However, where they
      are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State
      law, compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each
      controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing, provided that
      full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the damage
      is ensured. Any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may
      subsequently institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors
      involved in the same processing.\\n\\n(147)\\n\\nWhere specific rules on jurisdiction
      are contained in this Regulation, in particular as regards proceedings seeking
      a judicial remedy including compensation, against a controller or processor,
      general jurisdiction rules such as those of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of
      the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should not prejudice the application
      of such specific rules.\\n\\n(148)\\n\\nIn order to strengthen the enforcement
      of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines should
      be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instead
      of appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this
      Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed
      would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand
      may be issued instead of a fine. Due regard should however be given to the nature,
      gravity and duration of the infringement, the intentional character of the infringement,
      actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any
      relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became
      known to the supervisory authority, compliance with measures ordered against
      the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating
      or mitigating factor. The imposition of penalties including administrative fines
      should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the
      general principles of Union law and the Charter, including effective judicial
      protection and due process.\\n\\n(149)\\n\\nMember States should be able to
      lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this Regulation,
      including for infringements of national rules adopted pursuant to and within
      the limits of this Regulation. Those criminal penalties may also allow for the
      deprivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this Regulation.
      However, the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national
      rules and of administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle
      of ne bis in idem, as interpreted by the Court of Justice.\\n\\n(150)\\n\\nIn
      order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements
      of this Regulation, each supervisory authority should have the power to impose
      administrative fines. This Regulation should indicate infringements and the
      upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which
      should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual
      case, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation,
      with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement
      and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the
      obligations under this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences
      of the infringement. Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking,
      an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with
      Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are
      imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the supervisory authority should
      take account of the general level of income in the Member State as well as the
      economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the
      fine. The consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application
      of administrative fines. It should be for the Member States to determine whether
      and to which extent public authorities should be subject to administrative fines.
      Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application
      of other powers of the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this
      Regulation.\\n\\n(151)\\n\\nThe legal systems of Denmark and Estonia do not
      allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The rules on administrative
      fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by
      competent national courts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed
      by the supervisory authority in the framework of a misdemeanour procedure, provided
      that such an application of the rules in those Member States has an equivalent
      effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. Therefore
      the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation by
      the supervisory authority initiating the fine. In any event, the fines imposed
      should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\\n\\n(152)\\n\\nWhere this
      Regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in
      other cases, for example in cases of serious infringements of this Regulation,
      Member States should implement a system which provides for effective, proportionate
      and dissuasive penalties. The nature of such penalties, criminal or administrative,
      should be determined by Member State law.\\n\\n(153)\\n\\nMember States law
      should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information,
      including journalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the
      right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The processing
      of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the purposes of academic,
      artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exemptions
      from certain provisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right
      to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and
      information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter. This should apply in
      particular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in
      news archives and press libraries. Therefore, Member States should adopt legislative
      measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose
      of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exemptions
      and derogations on general principles, the rights of the data subject, the controller
      and the processor, the transfer of personal data to third countries or international
      organisations, the independent supervisory authorities, cooperation and consistency,
      and specific data-processing situations. Where such exemptions or derogations
      differ from one Member State to another, the law of the Member State to which
      the controller is subject should apply. In order to take account of the importance
      of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary
      to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly.\\n\\n(154)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be
      taken into account when applying this Regulation. Public access to official
      documents may be considered to be in the public interest. Personal data in documents
      held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed
      by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member
      State law to which the public authority or public body is subject. Such laws
      should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse of public
      sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may
      therefore provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection
      of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The reference to public authorities
      and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered
      by Member State law on public access to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council (14) leaves intact and in no way affects
      the level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
      personal data under the provisions of Union and Member State law, and in particular
      does not alter the obligations and rights set out in this Regulation. In particular,
      that Directive should not apply to documents to which access is excluded or
      restricted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of protection of personal
      data, and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain
      personal data the re-use of which has been provided for by law as being incompatible
      with the law concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the
      processing of personal data.\\n\\n(155)\\n\\nMember State law or collective
      agreements, including \u2018works agreements\u2019, may provide for specific
      rules on the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context,
      in particular for the conditions under which personal data in the employment
      context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the purposes
      of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including
      discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management,
      planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace,
      health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment,
      on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment,
      and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship.\\n\\n(156)\\n\\nThe
      processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to
      appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant
      to this Regulation. Those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational
      measures are in place in order to ensure, in particular, the principle of data
      minimisation. The further processing of personal data for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility
      to fulfil those purposes by processing data which do not permit or no longer
      permit the identification of data subjects, provided that appropriate safeguards
      exist (such as, for instance, pseudonymisation of the data). Member States should
      provide for appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. Member States should be authorised to provide, under
      specific conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects,
      specifications and derogations with regard to the information requirements and
      rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgotten, to restriction of processing,
      to data portability, and to object when processing personal data for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. The conditions and safeguards in question may entail
      specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate
      in the light of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical
      and organisational measures aimed at minimising the processing of personal data
      in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles. The processing
      of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant
      legislation such as on clinical trials.\\n\\n(157)\\n\\nBy coupling information
      from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard
      to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and
      depression. On the basis of registries, research results can be enhanced, as
      they draw on a larger population. Within social science, research on the basis
      of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term
      correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education
      with other life conditions. Research results obtained through registries provide
      solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation
      and implementation of knowledge-based policy, improve the quality of life for
      a number of people and improve the efficiency of social services. In order to
      facilitate scientific research, personal data can be processed for scientific
      research purposes, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out
      in Union or Member State law.\\n\\n(158)\\n\\nWhere personal data are processed
      for archiving purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing,
      bearing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. Public
      authorities or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest
      should be services which, pursuant to Union or Member State law, have a legal
      obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote,
      disseminate and provide access to records of enduring value for general public
      interest. Member States should also be authorised to provide for the further
      processing of personal data for archiving purposes, for example with a view
      to providing specific information related to the political behaviour under former
      totalitarian state regimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, in particular
      the Holocaust, or war crimes.\\n\\n(159)\\n\\nWhere personal data are processed
      for scientific research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that
      processing. For the purposes of this Regulation, the processing of personal
      data for scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner
      including for example technological development and demonstration, fundamental
      research, applied research and privately funded research. In addition, it should
      take into account the Union's objective under Article 179(1) TFEU of achieving
      a European Research Area. Scientific research purposes should also include studies
      conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. To meet the specificities
      of processing personal data for scientific research purposes, specific conditions
      should apply in particular as regards the publication or otherwise disclosure
      of personal data in the context of scientific research purposes. If the result
      of scientific research in particular in the health context gives reason for
      further measures in the interest of the data subject, the general rules of this
      Regulation should apply in view of those measures.\\n\\n(160)\\n\\nWhere personal
      data are processed for historical research purposes, this Regulation should
      also apply to that processing. This should also include historical research
      and research for genealogical purposes, bearing in mind that this Regulation
      should not apply to deceased persons.\\n\\n(161)\\n\\nFor the purpose of consenting
      to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials, the
      relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (15) should apply.\\n\\n(162)\\n\\nWhere personal data are
      processed for statistical purposes, this Regulation should apply to that processing.
      Union or Member State law should, within the limits of this Regulation, determine
      statistical content, control of access, specifications for the processing of
      personal data for statistical purposes and appropriate measures to safeguard
      the rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality.
      Statistical purposes mean any operation of collection and the processing of
      personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical
      results. Those statistical results may further be used for different purposes,
      including a scientific research purpose. The statistical purpose implies that
      the result of processing for statistical purposes is not personal data, but
      aggregate data, and that this result or the personal data are not used in support
      of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person.\\n\\n(163)\\n\\nThe
      confidential information which the Union and national statistical authorities
      collect for the production of official European and official national statistics
      should be protected. European statistics should be developed, produced and disseminated
      in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in Article 338(2) TFEU,
      while national statistics should also comply with Member State law. Regulation
      (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) provides
      further specifications on statistical confidentiality for European statistics.\\n\\n(164)\\n\\nAs
      regards the powers of the supervisory authorities to obtain from the controller
      or processor access to personal data and access to their premises, Member States
      may adopt by law, within the limits of this Regulation, specific rules in order
      to safeguard the professional or other equivalent secrecy obligations, in so
      far as necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with
      an obligation of professional secrecy. This is without prejudice to existing
      Member State obligations to adopt rules on professional secrecy where required
      by Union law.\\n\\n(165)\\n\\nThis Regulation respects and does not prejudice
      the status under existing constitutional law of churches and religious associations
      or communities in the Member States, as recognised in Article 17 TFEU.\\n\\n(166)\\n\\nIn
      order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, namely to protect the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the
      protection of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal data
      within the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU
      should be delegated to the Commission. In particular, delegated acts should
      be adopted in respect of criteria and requirements for certification mechanisms,
      information to be presented by standardised icons and procedures for providing
      such icons. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate
      consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission,
      when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,
      timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament
      and to the Council.\\n\\n(167)\\n\\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for
      the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred
      on the Commission when provided for by this Regulation. Those powers should
      be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. In that context,
      the Commission should consider specific measures for micro, small and medium-sized
      enterprises.\\n\\n(168)\\n\\nThe examination procedure should be used for the
      adoption of implementing acts on standard contractual clauses between controllers
      and processors and between processors; codes of conduct; technical standards
      and mechanisms for certification; the adequate level of protection afforded
      by a third country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country,
      or an international organisation; standard protection clauses; formats and procedures
      for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers, processors
      and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules; mutual assistance;
      and arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between
      supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board.\\n\\n(169)\\n\\nThe
      Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where available
      evidence reveals that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within
      that third country, or an international organisation does not ensure an adequate
      level of protection, and imperative grounds of urgency so require.\\n\\n(170)\\n\\nSince
      the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection
      of natural persons and the free flow of personal data throughout the Union,
      cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason
      of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the
      Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as
      set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with
      the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation
      does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\\n\\n(171)\\n\\nDirective
      95/46/EC should be repealed by this Regulation. Processing already under way
      on the date of application of this Regulation should be brought into conformity
      with this Regulation within the period of two years after which this Regulation
      enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pursuant to Directive
      95/46/EC, it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent
      again if the manner in which the consent has been given is in line with the
      conditions of this Regulation, so as to allow the controller to continue such
      processing after the date of application of this Regulation. Commission decisions
      adopted and authorisations by supervisory authorities based on Directive 95/46/EC
      remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed.\\n\\n(172)\\n\\nThe European
      Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of
      Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 7 March 2012 (17).\\n\\n(173)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation should apply to all matters concerning the protection of fundamental
      rights and freedoms vis-\xE0-vis the processing of personal data which are not
      subject to specific obligations with the same objective set out in Directive
      2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), including the
      obligations on the controller and the rights of natural persons. In order to
      clarify the relationship between this Regulation and Directive 2002/58/EC, that
      Directive should be amended accordingly. Once this Regulation is adopted, Directive
      2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with
      this Regulation,\\n\\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nGeneral
      provisions\\n\\nArticle 1\\n\\nSubject-matter and objectives\\n\\n1. This Regulation
      lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to
      the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal
      data.\\n\\n2. This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural
      persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.\\n\\n3.
      The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted
      nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons
      with regard to the processing of personal data.\\n\\nArticle 2\\n\\nMaterial
      scope\\n\\n1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly
      or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means
      of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form
      part of a filing system.\\n\\n2. This Regulation does not apply to the processing
      of personal data:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nin the course of an activity which falls outside
      the scope of Union law;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nby the Member States when carrying out
      activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the TEU;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nby
      a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nby
      competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection
      or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\\n\\n3.
      For the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices
      and agencies, Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 applies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001
      and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data shall
      be adapted to the principles and rules of this Regulation in accordance with
      Article 98.\\n\\n4. This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application
      of Directive 2000/31/EC, in particular of the liability rules of intermediary
      service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive.\\n\\nArticle 3\\n\\nTerritorial
      scope\\n\\n1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in
      the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor
      in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union
      or not.\\n\\n2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of
      data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established
      in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data
      subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the
      Union.\\n\\n3. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data by
      a controller not established in the Union, but in a place where Member State
      law applies by virtue of public international law.\\n\\nArticle 4\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nFor
      the purposes of this Regulation:\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\u2018personal data\u2019 means
      any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data
      subject\u2019); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
      directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as
      a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to
      one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
      economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\u2018processing\u2019
      means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data
      or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection,
      recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,
      consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making
      available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\u2018restriction
      of processing\u2019 means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of
      limiting their processing in the future;\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\u2018profiling\u2019
      means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use
      of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural
      person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural
      person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
      interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\u2018pseudonymisation\u2019
      means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data
      can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
      information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and
      is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal
      data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\u2018filing
      system\u2019 means any structured set of personal data which are accessible
      according to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed
      on a functional or geographical basis;\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\u2018controller\u2019
      means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which,
      alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing
      of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined
      by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its
      nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\u2018processor\u2019
      means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which
      processes personal data on behalf of the controller;\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\u2018recipient\u2019
      means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to
      which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However,
      public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular
      inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
      recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be

      5\\n\\nPrinciples relating to processing of personal data\\n\\n1. Personal data
      shall be:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nprocessed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner
      in relation to the data subject (\u2018lawfulness, fairness and transparency\u2019);\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ncollected
      for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in
      a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered
      to be incompatible with the initial purposes (\u2018purpose limitation\u2019);\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nadequate,
      relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
      they are processed (\u2018data minimisation\u2019);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\naccurate and,
      where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
      that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which
      they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (\u2018accuracy\u2019);\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nkept
      in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is
      necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal
      data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed
      solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject
      to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required
      by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data
      subject (\u2018storage limitation\u2019);\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessed in a manner
      that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
      against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction
      or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (\u2018integrity
      and confidentiality\u2019).\\n\\n2. The controller shall be responsible for,
      and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (\u2018accountability\u2019).\\n\\nArticle
      6\\n\\nLawfulness of processing\\n\\n1. Processing shall be lawful only if and
      to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data
      for one or more specific purposes;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for
      the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order
      to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary in order to protect the vital
      interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller
      or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests
      or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection
      of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\\n\\nPoint
      (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public
      authorities in the performance of their tasks.\\n\\n2. Member States may maintain
      or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules
      of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c)
      and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for
      the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including
      for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.\\n\\n3.
      The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1
      shall be laid down by:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nUnion law; or\\n</document_text>\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\"max_tokens\":4096,\"stream\":false,\"temperature\":0.3,\"top_p\":0.3}"

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"

      (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\\n\\nof 27 April
      2016\\n\\non the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing
      of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
      95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\\n\\n(Text with EEA relevance)\\n\\nTHE
      EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\\n\\nHaving regard
      to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article
      16 thereof,\\n\\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\\n\\nAfter
      transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\\n\\nHaving
      regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\\n\\nHaving
      regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\\n\\nActing in accordance
      with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\\n\\nWhereas:\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThe
      protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data
      is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
      the European Union (the \u2018Charter\u2019) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty
      on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the
      right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nThe
      principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to
      the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or
      residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their
      right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute
      to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an
      economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the
      convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being
      of natural persons.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights
      and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure
      the free flow of personal data between Member States.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection
      of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation
      to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights,
      in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects
      all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in
      the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private
      and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom
      of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information,
      freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair
      trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nThe economic
      and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market
      has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The
      exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural
      persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National
      authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate
      and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry
      out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nRapid
      technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for
      the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of
      personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies
      and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale
      in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal
      information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both
      the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of
      personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international
      organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data.\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nThose
      developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in
      the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the
      trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market.
      Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical
      certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should
      be enhanced.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nWhere this Regulation provides for specifications
      or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far
      as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible
      to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into
      their national law.\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nThe objectives and principles of Directive
      95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation
      of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public
      perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons,
      in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection
      of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the
      protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data
      in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the
      Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit
      of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede
      authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such
      a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences
      in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons
      and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the
      level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard
      to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent
      and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal
      data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal
      data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried
      out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
      the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national
      provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation.
      In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing
      Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas
      that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of
      manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing
      of special categories of personal data (\u2018sensitive data\u2019). To that
      extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the
      circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more
      precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nEffective
      protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening
      and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations
      of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well
      as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for
      the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in
      the Member States.\\n\\n(12)\\n\\nArticle 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament
      and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural
      persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating
      to the free movement of personal data.\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nIn order to ensure a consistent
      level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent
      divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal
      market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency
      for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally
      enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and
      processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data,
      and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation
      between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning
      of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within
      the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection
      of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account
      of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this
      Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees
      with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies,
      and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take
      account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in
      the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized
      enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation
      2003/361/EC (5).\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nThe protection afforded by this Regulation should
      apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence,
      in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not
      cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular
      undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of
      the legal person and the contact details of the legal person.\\n\\n(15)\\n\\nIn
      order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of
      natural persons should be technologically neutral and should not depend on the
      techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing
      of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the
      personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system.
      Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured
      according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.\\n\\n(16)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and
      freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall
      outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security.
      This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member
      States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security
      policy of the Union.\\n\\n(17)\\n\\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European
      Parliament and of the Council (6) applies to the processing of personal data
      by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No
      45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal
      data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this Regulation
      and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and
      coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of
      Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should follow after the adoption of this Regulation,
      in order to allow application at the same time as this Regulation.\\n\\n(18)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person
      in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection
      to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or household activities could
      include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and
      online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this
      Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for
      processing personal data for such personal or household activities.\\n\\n(19)\\n\\nThe
      protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
      by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation,
      detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security
      and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal
      act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for
      those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under
      this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more
      specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (7). Member States may entrust competent authorities within
      the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily
      carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or
      prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including
      the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that
      the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is
      within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation.\\n\\nWith
      regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for
      purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able
      to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of
      the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific
      requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities
      for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational
      and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing
      of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation,
      this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific
      conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction
      constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
      safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention,
      investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution
      of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention
      of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework
      of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories.\\n\\n(20)\\n\\nWhile
      this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial
      authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations
      and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by
      courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory authorities
      should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their
      judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in
      the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision-making. It should
      be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific
      bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular
      ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among
      members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle
      complaints in relation to such data processing operations.\\n\\n(21)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of
      the European Parliament and of the Council (8), in particular of the liability
      rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive.
      That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal
      market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between
      Member States.\\n\\n(22)\\n\\nAny processing of personal data in the context
      of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the
      Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of
      whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies
      the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The
      legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with
      a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect.\\n\\n(23)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which
      they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of
      data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established
      in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities
      are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective
      of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller
      or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union,
      it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor
      envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in
      the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or
      an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact
      details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where
      the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention,
      factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or
      more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that
      other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union,
      may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services
      to data subjects in the Union.\\n\\n(24)\\n\\nThe processing of personal data
      of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established
      in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to
      the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour
      takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity
      can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained
      whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent
      use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural
      person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for
      analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\\n\\n(25)\\n\\nWhere
      Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation
      should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a
      Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post.\\n\\n(26)\\n\\nThe principles
      of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified
      or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation,
      which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information
      should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To
      determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken
      of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either
      by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly
      or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to
      identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors,
      such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking
      into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and
      technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore
      not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate
      to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered
      anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.
      This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous
      information, including for statistical or research purposes.\\n\\n(27)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States
      may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased
      persons.\\n\\n(28)\\n\\nThe application of pseudonymisation to personal data
      can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and
      processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction
      of \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 in this Regulation is not intended to preclude
      any other measures of data protection.\\n\\n(29)\\n\\nIn order to create incentives
      to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymisation
      should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller
      when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary
      to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented,
      and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific
      data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data
      should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller.\\n\\n(30)\\n\\nNatural
      persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices,
      applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie
      identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.
      This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers
      and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles
      of the natural persons and identify them.\\n\\n(31)\\n\\nPublic authorities
      to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for
      the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities,
      financial investigation units, independent administrative authorities, or financial
      market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities
      markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which
      are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in
      accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent
      by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional
      and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection
      of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities
      should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes
      of the processing.\\n\\n(32)\\n\\nConsent should be given by a clear affirmative
      act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication
      of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating
      to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means,
      or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet
      website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another
      statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's
      acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence,
      pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent
      should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes.
      When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of
      them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic
      means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to
      the use of the service for which it is provided.\\n\\n(33)\\n\\nIt is often
      not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific
      research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should
      be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when
      in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects
      should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research
      or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose.\\n\\n(34)\\n\\nGenetic
      data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired
      genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of
      a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal,
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the
      analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained.\\n\\n(35)\\n\\nPersonal
      data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status
      of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or
      future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information
      about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or
      the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU
      of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) to that natural person; a
      number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify
      the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing
      or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including from genetic data
      and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability,
      disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical
      state of the data subject independent of its source, for example from a physician
      or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic
      test.\\n\\n(36)\\n\\nThe main establishment of a controller in the Union should
      be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions
      on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another
      establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment
      should be considered to be the main establishment. The main establishment of
      a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria
      and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining
      the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable
      arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of
      personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical
      means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities
      do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not
      determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the
      processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or,
      if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing
      activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and
      the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory
      authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment,
      but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a
      supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate
      in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the
      supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor
      has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities
      concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing
      is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling
      undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of
      undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined
      by another undertaking.\\n\\n(37)\\n\\nA group of undertakings should cover
      a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling
      undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over
      the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation
      or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules
      implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in
      undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings,
      as a group of undertakings.\\n\\n(38)\\n\\nChildren merit specific protection
      with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks,
      consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing
      of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the
      use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality
      or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children
      when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of
      parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive
      or counselling services offered directly to a child.\\n\\n(39)\\n\\nAny processing
      of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural
      persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or
      otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.
      The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication
      relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy
      to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns,
      in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller
      and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and
      transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their
      right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them
      which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules,
      safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how
      to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the
      specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and
      legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data.
      The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
      for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular,
      ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to
      a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the
      processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure
      that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should
      be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every
      reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate
      are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that
      ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including
      for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment
      used for the processing.\\n\\n(40)\\n\\nIn order for processing to be lawful,
      personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject
      concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation
      or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including
      the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data
      subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject
      prior to entering into a contract.\\n\\n(41)\\n\\nWhere this Regulation refers
      to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require
      a legislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements
      pursuant to the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However,
      such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its
      application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with
      the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u2018Court
      of Justice\u2019) and the European Court of Human Rights.\\n\\n(42)\\n\\nWhere
      processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be
      able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing
      operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on another
      matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact
      that and the extent to which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive
      93/13/EEC (10) a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should
      be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain
      language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed,
      the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller
      and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.
      Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine
      or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\\n\\n(43)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid
      legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there
      is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular
      where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that
      consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation.
      Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent
      to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being
      appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including
      the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent
      not being necessary for such performance.\\n\\n(44)\\n\\nProcessing should be
      lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to
      enter into a contract.\\n\\n(45)\\n\\nWhere processing is carried out in accordance
      with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis
      in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law
      for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations
      based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also
      be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore,
      that law could specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the
      lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining
      the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing,
      the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be
      disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to
      ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State
      law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the
      public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public
      authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where
      it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as
      public health and social protection and the management of health care services,
      by private law, such as a professional association.\\n\\n(46)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary
      to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or
      that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital
      interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where
      the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types
      of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital
      interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for
      humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or
      in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural
      and man-made disasters.\\n\\n(47)\\n\\nThe legitimate interests of a controller,
      including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed,
      or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that
      the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are
      not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data
      subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest
      could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship
      between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the
      data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the
      existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether
      a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection
      of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests
      and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the
      interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances
      where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that
      it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities
      to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing
      by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal
      data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes
      a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal
      data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate
      interest.\\n\\n(48)\\n\\nControllers that are part of a group of undertakings
      or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest
      in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal
      administrative purposes, including the processing of clients' or employees'
      personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal data, within
      a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain
      unaffected.\\n\\n(49)\\n\\nThe processing of personal data to the extent strictly
      necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information
      security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist,
      at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions
      that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality
      of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services
      offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities,
      by computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response
      teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and services
      and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate
      interest of the data controller concerned. This could, for example, include
      preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious
      code distribution and stopping \u2018denial of service\u2019 attacks and damage
      to computer and electronic communication systems.\\n\\n(50)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were
      initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible
      with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such
      a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the
      personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance
      of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
      authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine
      and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be
      regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations.
      The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of
      personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order
      to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the
      purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller,
      after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing,
      should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the
      purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal
      data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data
      subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further
      use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further
      processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in
      both the original and intended further processing operations.\\n\\nWhere the
      data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member
      State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic
      society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public
      interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data
      irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application
      of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular the information
      of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including
      the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or
      threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal
      data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act
      or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as
      being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmission
      in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal
      data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal,
      professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.\\n\\n(51)\\n\\nPersonal
      data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental
      rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing
      could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those
      personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,
      whereby the use of the term \u2018racial origin\u2019 in this Regulation does
      not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine
      the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should
      not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal
      data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed
      through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication
      of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing
      is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account
      that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in
      order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance
      with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the
      public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
      In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles
      and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the
      conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for
      processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided,
      inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect
      of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course
      of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose
      of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n(52)\\n\\nDerogating
      from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should
      also be allowed when provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to
      suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights,
      where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal
      data in the field of employment law, social protection law including pensions
      and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control
      of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a derogation
      may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management
      of health-care services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness
      of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the
      health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should
      also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment,
      exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative
      or out-of-court procedure.\\n\\n(53)\\n\\nSpecial categories of personal data
      which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes
      only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons
      and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health
      or social care services and systems, including processing by the management
      and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality
      control, management information and the general national and local supervision
      of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social
      care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes,
      or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has
      to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in
      the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation
      should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories
      of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular
      where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related
      purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union
      or Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as
      to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons.
      Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions,
      including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric
      data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow
      of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border
      processing of such data.\\n\\n(54)\\n\\nThe processing of special categories
      of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas
      of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should
      be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons. In that context, \u2018public health\u2019 should
      be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (11), namely all elements related to health, namely health
      status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect
      on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care,
      the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care
      expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data
      concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal
      data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or
      insurance and banking companies.\\n\\n(55)\\n\\nMoreover, the processing of
      personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims,
      laid down by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially
      recognised religious associations, is carried out on grounds of public interest.\\n\\n(56)\\n\\nWhere
      in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system
      in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's
      political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons
      of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.\\n\\n(57)\\n\\nIf
      the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to
      identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire
      additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose
      of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller
      should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject
      in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. Identification should
      include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication
      mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to
      the on-line service offered by the data controller.\\n\\n(58)\\n\\nThe principle
      of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to
      the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that
      clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation
      be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example,
      when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance
      in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity
      of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether,
      by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being
      collected, such as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit
      specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is
      addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the
      child can easily understand.\\n\\n(59)\\n\\nModalities should be provided for
      facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation,
      including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge,
      in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the
      exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for
      requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed
      by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests
      from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month
      and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any
      such requests.\\n\\n(60)\\n\\nThe principles of fair and transparent processing
      require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing
      operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with
      any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing
      taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal
      data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the
      existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal
      data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed
      whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences,
      where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided
      in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible,
      intelligible and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the intended
      processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be machine-readable.\\n\\n(61)\\n\\nThe
      information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data
      subject should be given to him or her at the time of collection from the data
      subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source, within
      a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal
      data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should
      be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where
      the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than
      that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject
      prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and
      other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be
      provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general
      information should be provided.\\n\\n(62)\\n\\nHowever, it is not necessary
      to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already
      possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal
      data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to
      the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate
      effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried
      out for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of data
      subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should
      be taken into consideration.\\n\\n(63)\\n\\nA data subject should have the right
      of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her,
      and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be
      aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. This includes the right
      for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example
      the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses,
      examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or
      interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to
      know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for
      which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the
      personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic
      involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based
      on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller
      should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide
      the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right
      should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade
      secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting
      the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal
      to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes
      a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller
      should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data
      subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request
      relates.\\n\\n(64)\\n\\nThe controller should use all reasonable measures to
      verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in
      the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not
      retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential
      requests.\\n\\n(65)\\n\\nA data subject should have the right to have personal
      data concerning him or her rectified and a \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019
      where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member
      State law to which the controller is subject. In particular, a data subject
      should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer
      processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
      purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject
      has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data
      concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does
      not otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular
      where the data subject has given his or her consent as a child and is not fully
      aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such
      personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to
      exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child.
      However, the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it
      is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information,
      for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried
      out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
      the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health,
      for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence
      of legal claims.\\n\\n(66)\\n\\nTo strengthen the right to be forgotten in the
      online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way
      that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to
      inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any
      links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In doing so, that
      controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology
      and the means available to the controller, including technical measures, to
      inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subject's
      request.\\n\\n(67)\\n\\nMethods by which to restrict the processing of personal
      data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the selected data to another
      processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or
      temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems,
      the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means
      in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing
      operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data
      is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system.\\n\\n(68)\\n\\nTo further
      strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal
      data is carried out by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed
      to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided
      to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable
      format, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be
      encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. That
      right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the
      basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance
      of a contract. It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground
      other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be
      exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their
      public duties. It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal
      data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data
      subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should
      not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing
      systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal
      data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal
      data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects
      in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice
      the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the
      limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular,
      not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have
      been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent
      that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance
      of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the
      right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to
      another.\\n\\n(69)\\n\\nWhere personal data might lawfully be processed because
      processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
      interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller,
      or on grounds of the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party,
      a data subject should, nevertheless, be entitled to object to the processing
      of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should
      be for the controller to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest
      overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\\n\\n(70)\\n\\nWhere
      personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject
      should have the right to object to such processing, including profiling to the
      extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether with regard to initial
      or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That right should be
      explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly
      and separately from any other information.\\n\\n(71)\\n\\nThe data subject should
      have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure,
      evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on
      automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her
      or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of
      an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention.
      Such processing includes \u2018profiling\u2019 that consists of any form of
      automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating
      to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning
      the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
      preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where
      it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects
      him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling,
      should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to
      which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring
      and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards
      and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to
      ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller,
      or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data
      subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit
      consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards,
      which should include specific information to the data subject and the right
      to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain
      an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge
      the decision. Such measure should not concern a child.\\n\\nIn order to ensure
      fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into
      account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are
      processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical
      procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures
      appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies
      in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal
      data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the
      interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory
      effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political
      opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status
      or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect. Automated
      decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should
      be allowed only under specific conditions.\\n\\n(72)\\n\\nProfiling is subject
      to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such
      as the legal grounds for processing or data protection principles. The European
      Data Protection Board established by this Regulation (the \u2018Board\u2019)
      should be able to issue guidance in that context.\\n\\n(73)\\n\\nRestrictions
      concerning specific principles and the rights of information, access to and
      rectification or erasure of personal data, the right to data portability, the
      right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the communication
      of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations
      of the controllers may be imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessary
      and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard public security, including
      the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade disasters,
      the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution
      of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention
      of threats to public security, or of breaches of ethics for regulated professions,
      other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member
      State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union
      or of a Member State, the keeping of public registers kept for reasons of general
      public interest, further processing of archived personal data to provide specific
      information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state
      regimes or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of
      others, including social protection, public health and humanitarian purposes.
      Those restrictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in
      the Charter and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
      and Fundamental Freedoms.\\n\\n(74)\\n\\nThe responsibility and liability of
      the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller
      or on the controller's behalf should be established. In particular, the controller
      should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able
      to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation,
      including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into
      account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk
      to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(75)\\n\\nThe risk to the
      rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity,
      may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material
      or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to
      discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation,
      loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy,
      unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic
      or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights
      and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data;
      where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin, political
      opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the
      processing of genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life
      or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures; where personal
      aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting aspects concerning
      performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests,
      reliability or behaviour, location or movements, in order to create or use personal
      profiles; where personal data of vulnerable natural persons, in particular of
      children, are processed; or where processing involves a large amount of personal
      data and affects a large number of data subjects.\\n\\n(76)\\n\\nThe likelihood
      and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should
      be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
      processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment,
      by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk
      or a high risk.\\n\\n(77)\\n\\nGuidance on the implementation of appropriate
      measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor,
      especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing,
      their assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the
      identification of best practices to mitigate the risk, could be provided in
      particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications, guidelines
      provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer.
      The Board may also issue guidelines on processing operations that are considered
      to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons and indicate what measures may be sufficient in such cases to address
      such risk.\\n\\n(78)\\n\\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons with regard to the processing of personal data require that appropriate
      technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements
      of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with
      this Regulation, the controller should adopt internal policies and implement
      measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design
      and data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of
      minimising the processing of personal data, pseudonymising personal data as
      soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and processing of
      personal data, enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing, enabling
      the controller to create and improve security features. When developing, designing,
      selecting and using applications, services and products that are based on the
      processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers
      of the products, services and applications should be encouraged to take into
      account the right to data protection when developing and designing such products,
      services and applications and, with due regard to the state of the art, to make
      sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection
      obligations. The principles of data protection by design and by default should
      also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders.\\n\\n(79)\\n\\nThe
      protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility
      and liability of controllers and processors, also in relation to the monitoring
      by and measures of supervisory authorities, requires a clear allocation of the
      responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines
      the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where
      a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller.\\n\\n(80)\\n\\nWhere
      a controller or a processor not established in the Union is processing personal
      data of data subjects who are in the Union whose processing activities are related
      to the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the
      data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union, or to the monitoring
      of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union, the
      controller or the processor should designate a representative, unless the processing
      is occasional, does not include processing, on a large scale, of special categories
      of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions
      and offences, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes
      of the processing or if the controller is a public authority or body. The representative
      should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed
      by any supervisory authority. The representative should be explicitly designated
      by a written mandate of the controller or of the processor to act on its behalf
      with regard to its obligations under this Regulation. The designation of such
      a representative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller
      or of the processor under this Regulation. Such a representative should perform
      its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller or processor,
      including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard
      to any action taken to ensure compliance with this Regulation. The designated
      representative should be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of
      non-compliance by the controller or processor.\\n\\n(81)\\n\\nTo ensure compliance
      with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be
      carried out by the processor on behalf of the controller, when entrusting a
      processor with processing activities, the controller should use only processors
      providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms of expert knowledge,
      reliability and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures
      which will meet the requirements of this Regulation, including for the security
      of processing. The adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct
      or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate
      compliance with the obligations of the controller. The carrying-out of processing
      by a processor should be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union
      or Member State law, binding the processor to the controller, setting out the
      subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the
      processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects, taking
      into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the processor in the
      context of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms
      of the data subject. The controller and processor may choose to use an individual
      contract or standard contractual clauses which are adopted either directly by
      the Commission or by a supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency
      mechanism and then adopted by the Commission. After the completion of the processing
      on behalf of the controller, the processor should, at the choice of the controller,
      return or delete the personal data, unless there is a requirement to store the
      personal data under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject.\\n\\n(82)\\n\\nIn
      order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor
      should maintain records of processing activities under its responsibility. Each
      controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory
      authority and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might
      serve for monitoring those processing operations.\\n\\n(83)\\n\\nIn order to
      maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation,
      the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing
      and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. Those measures
      should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking
      into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation
      to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing
      data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented
      by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
      alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted,
      stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical, material
      or non-material damage.\\n\\n(84)\\n\\nIn order to enhance compliance with this
      Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible
      for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment to evaluate, in
      particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that risk. The
      outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the
      appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing
      of personal data complies with this Regulation. Where a data-protection impact
      assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the
      controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology
      and costs of implementation, a consultation of the supervisory authority should
      take place prior to the processing.\\n\\n(85)\\n\\nA personal data breach may,
      if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material
      or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their
      personal data or limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft
      or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage
      to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional
      secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural
      person concerned. Therefore, as soon as the controller becomes aware that a
      personal data breach has occurred, the controller should notify the personal
      data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible,
      not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the controller
      is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that
      the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons. Where such notification cannot be achieved within 72 hours,
      the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification and information
      may be provided in phases without undue further delay.\\n\\n(86)\\n\\nThe controller
      should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach, without undue
      delay, where that personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to allow him or her to
      take the necessary precautions. The communication should describe the nature
      of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person
      concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects. Such communications to data
      subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation
      with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other
      relevant authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need
      to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication
      with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against
      continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication.\\n\\n(87)\\n\\nIt
      should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational
      measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data
      breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and
      the data subject. The fact that the notification was made without undue delay
      should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity
      of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the
      data subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory
      authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation.\\n\\n(88)\\n\\nIn
      setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the
      notification of personal data breaches, due consideration should be given to
      the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not personal data had
      been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting
      the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules
      and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law-enforcement
      authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation
      of the circumstances of a personal data breach.\\n\\n(89)\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC
      provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data
      to the supervisory authorities. While that obligation produces administrative
      and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection
      of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should
      therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms
      which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely
      to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue
      of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations
      may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or are of
      a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out
      before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the
      time that has elapsed since the initial processing.\\n\\n(90)\\n\\nIn such cases,
      a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller
      prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity
      of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes
      of the processing and the sources of the risk. That impact assessment should
      include, in particular, the measures, safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for
      mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating
      compliance with this Regulation.\\n\\n(91)\\n\\nThis should in particular apply
      to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount
      of personal data at regional, national or supranational level and which could
      affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high
      risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in accordance with
      the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a
      large scale as well as to other processing operations which result in a high
      risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular where those
      operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights.
      A data protection impact assessment should also be made where personal data
      are processed for taking decisions regarding specific natural persons following
      any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural
      persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special
      categories of personal data, biometric data, or data on criminal convictions
      and offences or related security measures. A data protection impact assessment
      is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale,
      especially when using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where
      the competent supervisory authority considers that the processing is likely
      to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular
      because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service
      or a contract, or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale.
      The processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale
      if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual
      physician, other health care professional or lawyer. In such cases, a data protection
      impact assessment should not be mandatory.\\n\\n(92)\\n\\nThere are circumstances
      under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection
      impact assessment to be broader than a single project, for example where public
      authorities or bodies intend to establish a common application or processing
      platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common application
      or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely
      used horizontal activity.\\n\\n(93)\\n\\nIn the context of the adoption of the
      Member State law on which the performance of the tasks of the public authority
      or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation
      or set of operations in question, Member States may deem it necessary to carry
      out such assessment prior to the processing activities.\\n\\n(94)\\n\\nWhere
      a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in
      the absence of safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the
      risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and
      the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable
      means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation, the supervisory
      authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activities. Such
      high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent
      and frequency of processing, which may result also in a realisation of damage
      or interference with the rights and freedoms of the natural person. The supervisory
      authority should respond to the request for consultation within a specified
      period. However, the absence of a reaction of the supervisory authority within
      that period should be without prejudice to any intervention of the supervisory
      authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation,
      including the power to prohibit processing operations. As part of that consultation
      process, the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with
      regard to the processing at issue may be submitted to the supervisory authority,
      in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(95)\\n\\nThe processor should assist the
      controller, where necessary and upon request, in ensuring compliance with the
      obligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments
      and from prior consultation of the supervisory authority.\\n\\n(96)\\n\\nA consultation
      of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation
      of a legislative or regulatory measure which provides for the processing of
      personal data, in order to ensure compliance of the intended processing with
      this Regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data
      subject.\\n\\n(97)\\n\\nWhere the processing is carried out by a public authority,
      except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial
      capacity, where, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller
      whose core activities consist of processing operations that require regular
      and systematic monitoring of the data subjects on a large scale, or where the
      core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on
      a large scale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences, a person with expert knowledge of data protection
      law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor internal
      compliance with this Regulation. In the private sector, the core activities
      of a controller relate to its primary activities and do not relate to the processing
      of personal data as ancillary activities. The necessary level of expert knowledge
      should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations
      carried out and the protection required for the personal data processed by the
      controller or the processor. Such data protection officers, whether or not they
      are an employee of the controller, should be in a position to perform their
      duties and tasks in an independent manner.\\n\\n(98)\\n\\nAssociations or other
      bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged
      to draw up codes of conduct, within the limits of this Regulation, so as to
      facilitate the effective application of this Regulation, taking account of the
      specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and
      the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. In particular, such
      codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors,
      taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights
      and freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(99)\\n\\nWhen drawing up a code of conduct,
      or when amending or extending such a code, associations and other bodies representing
      categories of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders,
      including data subjects where feasible, and have regard to submissions received
      and views expressed in response to such consultations.\\n\\n(100)\\n\\nIn order
      to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment
      of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged,
      allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant
      products and services.\\n\\n(101)\\n\\nFlows of personal data to and from countries
      outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion
      of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in such flows
      has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal
      data. However, when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers,
      processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations,
      the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation
      should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal
      data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors
      in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any event,
      transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried
      out in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only
      if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid
      down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal
      data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by
      the controller or processor.\\n\\n(102)\\n\\nThis Regulation is without prejudice
      to international agreements concluded between the Union and third countries
      regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for
      the data subjects. Member States may conclude international agreements which
      involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations,
      as far as such agreements do not affect this Regulation or any other provisions
      of Union law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental
      rights of the data subjects.\\n\\n(103)\\n\\nThe Commission may decide with
      effect for the entire Union that a third country, a territory or specified sector
      within a third country, or an international organisation, offers an adequate
      level of data protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout
      the Union as regards the third country or international organisation which is
      considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers of
      personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place
      without the need to obtain any further authorisation. The Commission may also
      decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to
      the third country or international organisation, to revoke such a decision.\\n\\n(104)\\n\\nIn
      line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular
      the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its assessment of
      the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third country,
      take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access
      to justice as well as international human rights norms and standards and its
      general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security,
      defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The
      adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector
      in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria, such
      as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards
      and legislation in force in the third country. The third country should offer
      guarantees ensuring an adequate level of protection essentially equivalent to
      that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are processed
      in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the third country should
      ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide
      for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data protection authorities,
      and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights
      and effective administrative and judicial redress.\\n\\n(105)\\n\\nApart from
      the international commitments the third country or international organisation
      has entered into, the Commission should take account of obligations arising
      from the third country's or international organisation's participation in multilateral
      or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal
      data, as well as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the
      third country's accession to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January
      1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing
      of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be taken into account. The
      Commission should consult the Board when assessing the level of protection in
      third countries or international organisations.\\n\\n(106)\\n\\nThe Commission
      should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a
      third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an
      international organisation, and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted
      on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its
      adequacy decisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism
      of their functioning. That periodic review should be conducted in consultation
      with the third country or international organisation in question and take into
      account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation.
      For the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the
      Commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the European
      Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources.
      The Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of
      the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the Committee within
      the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of
      the Council (12) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament
      and to the Council.\\n\\n(107)\\n\\nThe Commission may recognise that a third
      country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international
      organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently
      the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation
      should be prohibited, unless the requirements in this Regulation relating to
      transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules,
      and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision
      should be made for consultations between the Commission and such third countries
      or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely manner, inform
      the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into
      consultations with it in order to remedy the situation.\\n\\n(108)\\n\\nIn the
      absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor should take measures
      to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate
      safeguards for the data subject. Such appropriate safeguards may consist of
      making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted
      by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory
      authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority. Those
      safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the
      rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including
      the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies,
      including to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim
      compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular
      to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing,
      the principles of data protection by design and by default. Transfers may also
      be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies
      in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties
      or functions, including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative
      arrangements, such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable
      and effective rights for data subjects. Authorisation by the competent supervisory
      authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative
      arrangements that are not legally binding.\\n\\n(109)\\n\\nThe possibility for
      the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopted
      by the Commission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or
      processors neither from including the standard data-protection clauses in a
      wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another processor,
      nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do
      not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted
      by the Commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental
      rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors should be
      encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that
      supplement standard protection clauses.\\n\\n(110)\\n\\nA group of undertakings,
      or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, should be able
      to make use of approved binding corporate rules for its international transfers
      from the Union to organisations within the same group of undertakings, or group
      of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, provided that such corporate
      rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate
      safeguards for transfers or categories of transfers of personal data.\\n\\n(111)\\n\\nProvisions
      should be made for the possibility for transfers in certain circumstances where
      the data subject has given his or her explicit consent, where the transfer is
      occasional and necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim, regardless
      of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any out-of-court
      procedure, including procedures before regulatory bodies. Provision should also
      be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds of public
      interest laid down by Union or Member State law so require or where the transfer
      is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by
      the public or persons having a legitimate interest. In the latter case, such
      a transfer should not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories
      of the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for
      consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be
      made only at the request of those persons or, if they are to be the recipients,
      taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject.\\n\\n(112)\\n\\nThose
      derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary
      for important reasons of public interest, for example in cases of international
      data exchange between competition authorities, tax or customs administrations,
      between financial supervisory authorities, between services competent for social
      security matters, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing
      for contagious diseases or in order to reduce and/or eliminate doping in sport.
      A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary
      to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's or another
      person's vital interests, including physical integrity or life, if the data
      subject is incapable of giving consent. In the absence of an adequacy decision,
      Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly
      set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country
      or an international organisation. Member States should notify such provisions
      to the Commission. Any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation
      of personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of
      giving consent, with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva
      Conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law applicable in
      armed conflicts, could be considered to be necessary for an important reason
      of public interest or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject.\\n\\n(113)\\n\\nTransfers
      which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number
      of data subjects, could also be possible for the purposes of the compelling
      legitimate interests pursued by the controller, when those interests are not
      overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when
      the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer.
      The controller should give particular consideration to the nature of the personal
      data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations,
      as well as the situation in the country of origin, the third country and the
      country of final destination, and should provide suitable safeguards to protect
      fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing
      of their personal data. Such transfers should be possible only in residual cases
      where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, the legitimate expectations
      of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into consideration.
      The controller should inform the supervisory authority and the data subject
      about the transfer.\\n\\n(114)\\n\\nIn any case, where the Commission has taken
      no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third country, the
      controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects
      with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing of their data
      in the Union once those data have been transferred so that that they will continue
      to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards.\\n\\n(115)\\n\\nSome third
      countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly
      regulate the processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction
      of the Member States. This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions
      of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor
      to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international
      agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting
      third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application
      of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international
      law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured
      in the Union by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the
      conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This
      may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important
      ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the
      controller is subject.\\n\\n(116)\\n\\nWhen personal data moves across borders
      outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons
      to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from
      the unlawful use or disclosure of that information. At the same time, supervisory
      authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations
      relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together
      in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative
      or remedial powers, inconsistent legal regimes, and practical obstacles like
      resource constraints. Therefore, there is a need to promote closer cooperation
      among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information
      and carry out investigations with their international counterparts. For the
      purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate and
      provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for
      the protection of personal data, the Commission and the supervisory authorities
      should exchange information and cooperate in activities related to the exercise
      of their powers with competent authorities in third countries, based on reciprocity
      and in accordance with this Regulation.\\n\\n(117)\\n\\nThe establishment of
      supervisory authorities in Member States, empowered to perform their tasks and
      exercise their powers with complete independence, is an essential component
      of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their
      personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one supervisory
      authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative
      structure.\\n\\n(118)\\n\\nThe independence of supervisory authorities should
      not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject to control or monitoring
      mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review.\\n\\n(119)\\n\\nWhere
      a Member State establishes several supervisory authorities, it should establish
      by law mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of those supervisory
      authorities in the consistency mechanism. That Member State should in particular
      designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point
      for the effective participation of those authorities in the mechanism, to ensure
      swift and smooth cooperation with other supervisory authorities, the Board and
      the Commission.\\n\\n(120)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority should be provided
      with the financial and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary
      for the effective performance of their tasks, including those related to mutual
      assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the
      Union. Each supervisory authority should have a separate, public annual budget,
      which may be part of the overall state or national budget.\\n\\n(121)\\n\\nThe
      general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority should
      be laid down by law in each Member State and should in particular provide that
      those members are to be appointed, by means of a transparent procedure, either
      by the parliament, government or the head of State of the Member State on the
      basis of a proposal from the government, a member of the government, the parliament
      or a chamber of the parliament, or by an independent body entrusted under Member
      State law. In order to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority,
      the member or members should act with integrity, refrain from any action that
      is incompatible with their duties and should not, during their term of office,
      engage in any incompatible occupation, whether gainful or not. The supervisory
      authority should have its own staff, chosen by the supervisory authority or
      an independent body established by Member State law, which should be subject
      to the exclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority.\\n\\n(122)\\n\\nEach
      supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own Member
      State to exercise the powers and to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance
      with this Regulation. This should cover in particular the processing in the
      context of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor
      on the territory of its own Member State, the processing of personal data carried
      out by public authorities or private bodies acting in the public interest, processing
      affecting data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller
      or processor not established in the Union when targeting data subjects residing
      on its territory. This should include handling complaints lodged by a data subject,
      conducting investigations on the application of this Regulation and promoting
      public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the
      processing of personal data.\\n\\n(123)\\n\\nThe supervisory authorities should
      monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and contribute
      to its consistent application throughout the Union, in order to protect natural
      persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate
      the free flow of personal data within the internal market. For that purpose,
      the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the Commission,
      without the need for any agreement between Member States on the provision of
      mutual assistance or on such cooperation.\\n\\n(124)\\n\\nWhere the processing
      of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment
      of a controller or a processor in the Union and the controller or processor
      is established in more than one Member State, or where processing taking place
      in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or
      processor in the Union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect
      data subjects in more than one Member State, the supervisory authority for the
      main establishment of the controller or processor or for the single establishment
      of the controller or processor should act as lead authority. It should cooperate
      with the other authorities concerned, because the controller or processor has
      an establishment on the territory of their Member State, because data subjects
      residing on their territory are substantially affected, or because a complaint
      has been lodged with them. Also where a data subject not residing in that Member
      State has lodged a complaint, the supervisory authority with which such complaint
      has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority concerned. Within its
      tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this Regulation,
      the Board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to
      be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the processing in question
      substantially affects data subjects in more than one Member State and on what
      constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection.\\n\\n(125)\\n\\nThe lead authority
      should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the
      powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. In its capacity as
      lead authority, the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate
      the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process. Where
      the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part,
      that decision should be adopted by the supervisory authority with which the
      complaint has been lodged.\\n\\n(126)\\n\\nThe decision should be agreed jointly
      by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned
      and should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller
      or processor and be binding on the controller and processor. The controller
      or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this
      Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory
      authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards
      the processing activities in the Union.\\n\\n(127)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority
      not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local
      cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member
      State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing
      carried out in a single Member State and involves only data subjects in that
      single Member State, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing
      of employees' personal data in the specific employment context of a Member State.
      In such cases, the supervisory authority should inform the lead supervisory
      authority without delay about the matter. After being informed, the lead supervisory
      authority should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision
      on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory
      authorities concerned (\u2018one-stop-shop mechanism\u2019), or whether the
      supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level.
      When deciding whether it will handle the case, the lead supervisory authority
      should take into account whether there is an establishment of the controller
      or processor in the Member State of the supervisory authority which informed
      it in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-\xE0-vis the controller
      or processor. Where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case,
      the supervisory authority which informed it should have the possibility to submit
      a draft for a decision, of which the lead supervisory authority should take
      utmost account when preparing its draft decision in that one-stop-shop mechanism.\\n\\n(128)\\n\\nThe
      rules on the lead supervisory authority and the one-stop-shop mechanism should
      not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities or private
      bodies in the public interest. In such cases the only supervisory authority
      competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this Regulation
      should be the supervisory authority of the Member State where the public authority
      or private body is established.\\n\\n(129)\\n\\nIn order to ensure consistent
      monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory
      authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers,
      including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and authorisation
      and advisory powers, in particular in cases of complaints from natural persons,
      and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under Member
      State law, to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the
      judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings. Such powers should also
      include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation, including
      a ban, on processing. Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection
      of personal data under this Regulation. The powers of supervisory authorities
      should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set
      out in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable
      time. In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate
      in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the
      circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person to
      be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely
      is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons
      concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised
      in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such
      as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding
      measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous,
      indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure, the date of
      issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of the supervisory
      authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer
      to the right of an effective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements
      pursuant to Member State procedural law. The adoption of a legally binding decision
      implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the
      supervisory authority that adopted the decision.\\n\\n(130)\\n\\nWhere the supervisory
      authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory
      authority, the lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the
      supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged in accordance
      with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this Regulation.
      In such cases, the lead supervisory authority should, when taking measures intended
      to produce legal effects, including the imposition of administrative fines,
      take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority with which the
      complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any
      investigation on the territory of its own Member State in liaison with the competent
      supervisory authority.\\n\\n(131)\\n\\nWhere another supervisory authority should
      act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of the controller
      or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible
      infringement concerns only processing activities of the controller or processor
      in the Member State where the complaint has been lodged or the possible infringement
      detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to substantially
      affect data subjects in other Member States, the supervisory authority receiving
      a complaint or detecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail
      possible infringements of this Regulation should seek an amicable settlement
      with the controller and, if this proves unsuccessful, exercise its full range
      of powers. This should include: specific processing carried out in the territory
      of the Member State of the supervisory authority or with regard to data subjects
      on the territory of that Member State; processing that is carried out in the
      context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects
      in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority; or processing
      that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal obligations under
      Member State law.\\n\\n(132)\\n\\nAwareness-raising activities by supervisory
      authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures directed
      at controllers and processors, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      as well as natural persons in particular in the educational context.\\n\\n(133)\\n\\nThe
      supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and
      provide mutual assistance, so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement
      of this Regulation in the internal market. A supervisory authority requesting
      mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response
      to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request
      by the other supervisory authority.\\n\\n(134)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority
      should, where appropriate, participate in joint operations with other supervisory
      authorities. The requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond
      to the request within a specified time period.\\n\\n(135)\\n\\nIn order to ensure
      the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency
      mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established.
      That mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends
      to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations
      which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several
      Member States. It should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned
      or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency
      mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the
      Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties.\\n\\n(136)\\n\\nIn
      applying the consistency mechanism, the Board should, within a determined period
      of time, issue an opinion, if a majority of its members so decides or if so
      requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission. The Board
      should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are
      disputes between supervisory authorities. For that purpose, it should issue,
      in principle by a two-thirds majority of its members, legally binding decisions
      in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory
      authorities, in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory
      authority and supervisory authorities concerned on the merits of the case, in
      particular whether there is an infringement of this Regulation.\\n\\n(137)\\n\\nThere
      may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of
      data subjects, in particular when the danger exists that the enforcement of
      a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded. A supervisory authority
      should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its
      territory with a specified period of validity which should not exceed three
      months.\\n\\n(138)\\n\\nThe application of such mechanism should be a condition
      for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce legal effects by a supervisory
      authority in those cases where its application is mandatory. In other cases
      of cross-border relevance, the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory
      authority and supervisory authorities concerned should be applied and mutual
      assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the supervisory
      authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering
      the consistency mechanism.\\n\\n(139)\\n\\nIn order to promote the consistent
      application of this Regulation, the Board should be set up as an independent
      body of the Union. To fulfil its objectives, the Board should have legal personality.
      The Board should be represented by its Chair. It should replace the Working
      Party on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal
      Data established by Directive 95/46/EC. It should consist of the head of a supervisory
      authority of each Member State and the European Data Protection Supervisor or
      their respective representatives. The Commission should participate in the Board's
      activities without voting rights and the European Data Protection Supervisor
      should have specific voting rights. The Board should contribute to the consistent
      application of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by advising the
      Commission, in particular on the level of protection in third countries or international
      organisations, and promoting cooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout
      the Union. The Board should act independently when performing its tasks.\\n\\n(140)\\n\\nThe
      Board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the European Data Protection
      Supervisor. The staff of the European Data Protection Supervisor involved in
      carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this Regulation should perform
      its tasks exclusively under the instructions of, and report to, the Chair of
      the Board.\\n\\n(141)\\n\\nEvery data subject should have the right to lodge
      a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in the Member
      State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial
      remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter if the data subject considers
      that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed or where the supervisory
      authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses
      a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights
      of the data subject. The investigation following a complaint should be carried
      out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific
      case. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress
      and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires
      further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate
      information should be given to the data subject. In order to facilitate the
      submission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such
      as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically,
      without excluding other means of communication.\\n\\n(142)\\n\\nWhere a data
      subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed,
      he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation
      or association which is constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State,
      has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the
      field of the protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her
      behalf with a supervisory authority, exercise the right to a judicial remedy
      on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise
      the right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State
      may provide for such a body, organisation or association to have the right to
      lodge a complaint in that Member State, independently of a data subject's mandate,
      and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider
      that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing
      of personal data which infringes this Regulation. That body, organisation or
      association may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subject's behalf
      independently of the data subject's mandate.\\n\\n(143)\\n\\nAny natural or
      legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of
      the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article
      263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities concerned
      which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being
      notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the
      Board are of direct and individual concern to a controller, processor or complainant,
      the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within
      two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with
      Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each
      natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the
      competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which
      produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular
      the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory
      authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to
      an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory
      authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice
      provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority
      should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory
      authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member
      State's procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which
      should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant
      to the dispute before them.\\n\\nWhere a complaint has been rejected or dismissed
      by a supervisory authority, the complainant may bring proceedings before the
      courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating
      to the application of this Regulation, national courts which consider a decision
      on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment, may, or in the case
      provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the Court of Justice to give
      a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including this Regulation.
      Furthermore, where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision
      of the Board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision
      of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare
      the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the
      Court of Justice in accordance with Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court
      of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a national court
      may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the
      request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action
      for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was directly and individually
      concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down
      in Article 263 TFEU.\\n\\n(144)\\n\\nWhere a court seized of proceedings against
      a decision by a supervisory authority has reason to believe that proceedings
      concerning the same processing, such as the same subject matter as regards processing
      by the same controller or processor, or the same cause of action, are brought
      before a competent court in another Member State, it should contact that court
      in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings. If related proceedings
      are pending before a court in another Member State, any court other than the
      court first seized may stay its proceedings or may, on request of one of the
      parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seized if that court
      has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consolidation
      of such related proceedings. Proceedings are deemed to be related where they
      are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together
      in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate
      proceedings.\\n\\n(145)\\n\\nFor proceedings against a controller or processor,
      the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before the courts of
      the Member States where the controller or processor has an establishment or
      where the data subject resides, unless the controller is a public authority
      of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.\\n\\n(146)\\n\\nThe
      controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer
      as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or
      processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any
      way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted
      in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully
      reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any
      claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member
      State law. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing
      that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this
      Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data subjects
      should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered.
      Where controllers or processors are involved in the same processing, each controller
      or processor should be held liable for the entire damage. However, where they
      are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State
      law, compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each
      controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing, provided that
      full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the damage
      is ensured. Any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may
      subsequently institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors
      involved in the same processing.\\n\\n(147)\\n\\nWhere specific rules on jurisdiction
      are contained in this Regulation, in particular as regards proceedings seeking
      a judicial remedy including compensation, against a controller or processor,
      general jurisdiction rules such as those of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of
      the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should not prejudice the application
      of such specific rules.\\n\\n(148)\\n\\nIn order to strengthen the enforcement
      of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines should
      be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instead
      of appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this
      Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed
      would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand
      may be issued instead of a fine. Due regard should however be given to the nature,
      gravity and duration of the infringement, the intentional character of the infringement,
      actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any
      relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became
      known to the supervisory authority, compliance with measures ordered against
      the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating
      or mitigating factor. The imposition of penalties including administrative fines
      should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the
      general principles of Union law and the Charter, including effective judicial
      protection and due process.\\n\\n(149)\\n\\nMember States should be able to
      lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this Regulation,
      including for infringements of national rules adopted pursuant to and within
      the limits of this Regulation. Those criminal penalties may also allow for the
      deprivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this Regulation.
      However, the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national
      rules and of administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle
      of ne bis in idem, as interpreted by the Court of Justice.\\n\\n(150)\\n\\nIn
      order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements
      of this Regulation, each supervisory authority should have the power to impose
      administrative fines. This Regulation should indicate infringements and the
      upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which
      should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual
      case, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation,
      with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement
      and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the
      obligations under this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences
      of the infringement. Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking,
      an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with
      Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are
      imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the supervisory authority should
      take account of the general level of income in the Member State as well as the
      economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the
      fine. The consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application
      of administrative fines. It should be for the Member States to determine whether
      and to which extent public authorities should be subject to administrative fines.
      Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application
      of other powers of the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this
      Regulation.\\n\\n(151)\\n\\nThe legal systems of Denmark and Estonia do not
      allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The rules on administrative
      fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by
      competent national courts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed
      by the supervisory authority in the framework of a misdemeanour procedure, provided
      that such an application of the rules in those Member States has an equivalent
      effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. Therefore
      the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation by
      the supervisory authority initiating the fine. In any event, the fines imposed
      should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\\n\\n(152)\\n\\nWhere this
      Regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in
      other cases, for example in cases of serious infringements of this Regulation,
      Member States should implement a system which provides for effective, proportionate
      and dissuasive penalties. The nature of such penalties, criminal or administrative,
      should be determined by Member State law.\\n\\n(153)\\n\\nMember States law
      should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information,
      including journalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the
      right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The processing
      of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the purposes of academic,
      artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exemptions
      from certain provisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right
      to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and
      information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter. This should apply in
      particular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in
      news archives and press libraries. Therefore, Member States should adopt legislative
      measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose
      of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exemptions
      and derogations on general principles, the rights of the data subject, the controller
      and the processor, the transfer of personal data to third countries or international
      organisations, the independent supervisory authorities, cooperation and consistency,
      and specific data-processing situations. Where such exemptions or derogations
      differ from one Member State to another, the law of the Member State to which
      the controller is subject should apply. In order to take account of the importance
      of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary
      to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly.\\n\\n(154)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be
      taken into account when applying this Regulation. Public access to official
      documents may be considered to be in the public interest. Personal data in documents
      held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed
      by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member
      State law to which the public authority or public body is subject. Such laws
      should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse of public
      sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may
      therefore provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection
      of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The reference to public authorities
      and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered
      by Member State law on public access to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council (14) leaves intact and in no way affects
      the level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
      personal data under the provisions of Union and Member State law, and in particular
      does not alter the obligations and rights set out in this Regulation. In particular,
      that Directive should not apply to documents to which access is excluded or
      restricted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of protection of personal
      data, and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain
      personal data the re-use of which has been provided for by law as being incompatible
      with the law concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the
      processing of personal data.\\n\\n(155)\\n\\nMember State law or collective
      agreements, including \u2018works agreements\u2019, may provide for specific
      rules on the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context,
      in particular for the conditions under which personal data in the employment
      context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the purposes
      of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including
      discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management,
      planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace,
      health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment,
      on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment,
      and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship.\\n\\n(156)\\n\\nThe
      processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to
      appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant
      to this Regulation. Those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational
      measures are in place in order to ensure, in particular, the principle of data
      minimisation. The further processing of personal data for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility
      to fulfil those purposes by processing data which do not permit or no longer
      permit the identification of data subjects, provided that appropriate safeguards
      exist (such as, for instance, pseudonymisation of the data). Member States should
      provide for appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. Member States should be authorised to provide, under
      specific conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects,
      specifications and derogations with regard to the information requirements and
      rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgotten, to restriction of processing,
      to data portability, and to object when processing personal data for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. The conditions and safeguards in question may entail
      specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate
      in the light of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical
      and organisational measures aimed at minimising the processing of personal data
      in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles. The processing
      of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant
      legislation such as on clinical trials.\\n\\n(157)\\n\\nBy coupling information
      from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard
      to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and
      depression. On the basis of registries, research results can be enhanced, as
      they draw on a larger population. Within social science, research on the basis
      of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term
      correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education
      with other life conditions. Research results obtained through registries provide
      solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation
      and implementation of knowledge-based policy, improve the quality of life for
      a number of people and improve the efficiency of social services. In order to
      facilitate scientific research, personal data can be processed for scientific
      research purposes, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out
      in Union or Member State law.\\n\\n(158)\\n\\nWhere personal data are processed
      for archiving purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing,
      bearing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. Public
      authorities or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest
      should be services which, pursuant to Union or Member State law, have a legal
      obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote,
      disseminate and provide access to records of enduring value for general public
      interest. Member States should also be authorised to provide for the further
      processing of personal data for archiving purposes, for example with a view
      to providing specific information related to the political behaviour under former
      totalitarian state regimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, in particular
      the Holocaust, or war crimes.\\n\\n(159)\\n\\nWhere personal data are processed
      for scientific research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that
      processing. For the purposes of this Regulation, the processing of personal
      data for scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner
      including for example technological development and demonstration, fundamental
      research, applied research and privately funded research. In addition, it should
      take into account the Union's objective under Article 179(1) TFEU of achieving
      a European Research Area. Scientific research purposes should also include studies
      conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. To meet the specificities
      of processing personal data for scientific research purposes, specific conditions
      should apply in particular as regards the publication or otherwise disclosure
      of personal data in the context of scientific research purposes. If the result
      of scientific research in particular in the health context gives reason for
      further measures in the interest of the data subject, the general rules of this
      Regulation should apply in view of those measures.\\n\\n(160)\\n\\nWhere personal
      data are processed for historical research purposes, this Regulation should
      also apply to that processing. This should also include historical research
      and research for genealogical purposes, bearing in mind that this Regulation
      should not apply to deceased persons.\\n\\n(161)\\n\\nFor the purpose of consenting
      to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials, the
      relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (15) should apply.\\n\\n(162)\\n\\nWhere personal data are
      processed for statistical purposes, this Regulation should apply to that processing.
      Union or Member State law should, within the limits of this Regulation, determine
      statistical content, control of access, specifications for the processing of
      personal data for statistical purposes and appropriate measures to safeguard
      the rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality.
      Statistical purposes mean any operation of collection and the processing of
      personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical
      results. Those statistical results may further be used for different purposes,
      including a scientific research purpose. The statistical purpose implies that
      the result of processing for statistical purposes is not personal data, but
      aggregate data, and that this result or the personal data are not used in support
      of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person.\\n\\n(163)\\n\\nThe
      confidential information which the Union and national statistical authorities
      collect for the production of official European and official national statistics
      should be protected. European statistics should be developed, produced and disseminated
      in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in Article 338(2) TFEU,
      while national statistics should also comply with Member State law. Regulation
      (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) provides
      further specifications on statistical confidentiality for European statistics.\\n\\n(164)\\n\\nAs
      regards the powers of the supervisory authorities to obtain from the controller
      or processor access to personal data and access to their premises, Member States
      may adopt by law, within the limits of this Regulation, specific rules in order
      to safeguard the professional or other equivalent secrecy obligations, in so
      far as necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with
      an obligation of professional secrecy. This is without prejudice to existing
      Member State obligations to adopt rules on professional secrecy where required
      by Union law.\\n\\n(165)\\n\\nThis Regulation respects and does not prejudice
      the status under existing constitutional law of churches and religious associations
      or communities in the Member States, as recognised in Article 17 TFEU.\\n\\n(166)\\n\\nIn
      order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, namely to protect the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the
      protection of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal data
      within the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU
      should be delegated to the Commission. In particular, delegated acts should
      be adopted in respect of criteria and requirements for certification mechanisms,
      information to be presented by standardised icons and procedures for providing
      such icons. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate
      consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission,
      when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,
      timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament
      and to the Council.\\n\\n(167)\\n\\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for
      the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred
      on the Commission when provided for by this Regulation. Those powers should
      be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. In that context,
      the Commission should consider specific measures for micro, small and medium-sized
      enterprises.\\n\\n(168)\\n\\nThe examination procedure should be used for the
      adoption of implementing acts on standard contractual clauses between controllers
      and processors and between processors; codes of conduct; technical standards
      and mechanisms for certification; the adequate level of protection afforded
      by a third country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country,
      or an international organisation; standard protection clauses; formats and procedures
      for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers, processors
      and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules; mutual assistance;
      and arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between
      supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board.\\n\\n(169)\\n\\nThe
      Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where available
      evidence reveals that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within
      that third country, or an international organisation does not ensure an adequate
      level of protection, and imperative grounds of urgency so require.\\n\\n(170)\\n\\nSince
      the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection
      of natural persons and the free flow of personal data throughout the Union,
      cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason
      of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the
      Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as
      set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with
      the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation
      does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\\n\\n(171)\\n\\nDirective
      95/46/EC should be repealed by this Regulation. Processing already under way
      on the date of application of this Regulation should be brought into conformity
      with this Regulation within the period of two years after which this Regulation
      enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pursuant to Directive
      95/46/EC, it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent
      again if the manner in which the consent has been given is in line with the
      conditions of this Regulation, so as to allow the controller to continue such
      processing after the date of application of this Regulation. Commission decisions
      adopted and authorisations by supervisory authorities based on Directive 95/46/EC
      remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed.\\n\\n(172)\\n\\nThe European
      Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of
      Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 7 March 2012 (17).\\n\\n(173)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation should apply to all matters concerning the protection of fundamental
      rights and freedoms vis-\xE0-vis the processing of personal data which are not
      subject to specific obligations with the same objective set out in Directive
      2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), including the
      obligations on the controller and the rights of natural persons. In order to
      clarify the relationship between this Regulation and Directive 2002/58/EC, that
      Directive should be amended accordingly. Once this Regulation is adopted, Directive
      2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with
      this Regulation,\\n\\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nGeneral
      provisions\\n\\nArticle 1\\n\\nSubject-matter and objectives\\n\\n1. This Regulation
      lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to

      nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons
      with regard to the processing of personal data.\\n\\nArticle 2\\n\\nMaterial
      scope\\n\\n1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly
      or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means

      part of a filing system.\\n\\n2. This Regulation does not apply to the processing
      of personal data:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nin the course of an activity which falls outside
      the scope of Union law;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nby the Member States when carrying out
      activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the TEU;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nby
      a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nby
      competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection
      or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\\n\\n3.
      For the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices
      and agencies, Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 applies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001
      and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data shall
      be adapted to the principles and rules of this Regulation in accordance with
      Article 98.\\n\\n4. This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application
      of Directive 2000/31/EC, in particular of the liability rules of intermediary
      service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive.\\n\\nArticle 3\\n\\nTerritorial
      scope\\n\\n1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in
      the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor
      in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union
      or not.\\n\\n2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of
      data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established
      in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data
      subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the
      Union.\\n\\n3. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data by
      a controller not established in the Union, but in a place where Member State
      law applies by virtue of public international law.\\n\\nArticle 4\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nFor

      5\\n\\nPrinciples relating to processing of personal data\\n\\n1. Personal data
      shall be:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nprocessed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner
      in relation to the data subject (\u2018lawfulness, fairness and transparency\u2019);\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ncollected
      for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in
      a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered
      to be incompatible with the initial purposes (\u2018purpose limitation\u2019);\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nadequate,
      relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
      they are processed (\u2018data minimisation\u2019);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\naccurate and,
      where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
      that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which
      they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (\u2018accuracy\u2019);\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nkept
      in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is
      necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal
      data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed
      solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject
      to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required
      by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data
      subject (\u2018storage limitation\u2019);\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessed in a manner
      that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
      against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction
      or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (\u2018integrity
      and confidentiality\u2019).\\n\\n2. The controller shall be responsible for,
      and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (\u2018accountability\u2019).\\n\\nArticle
      6\\n\\nLawfulness of processing\\n\\n1. Processing shall be lawful only if and
      to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data
      for one or more specific purposes;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for
      the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order
      to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary in order to protect the vital
      interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller
      or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests
      or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection
      of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\\n\\nPoint
      (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public
      authorities in the performance of their tasks.\\n\\n2. Member States may maintain
      or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules
      of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c)
      and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for
      the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including
      for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.\\n\\n3.
      The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1
      shall be laid down by:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nUnion law; or\\n</document_text>\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\"max_tokens\":4096,\"stream\":false,\"temperature\":0.3,\"top_p\":0.3}"

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>

      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if

      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-

      (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\\n\\nof 27 April
      2016\\n\\non the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing
      of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
      95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\\n\\n(Text with EEA relevance)\\n\\nTHE
      EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\\n\\nHaving regard
      to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article
      16 thereof,\\n\\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\\n\\nAfter
      transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\\n\\nHaving
      regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\\n\\nHaving
      regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\\n\\nActing in accordance
      with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\\n\\nWhereas:\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThe
      protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data
      is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
      the European Union (the \u2018Charter\u2019) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty
      on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the
      right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nThe
      principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to
      the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or
      residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their
      right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute
      to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an
      economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the
      convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being
      of natural persons.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights
      and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure
      the free flow of personal data between Member States.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection
      of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation
      to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights,
      in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects
      all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in
      the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private
      and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom
      of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information,
      freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair
      trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nThe economic
      and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market
      has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The
      exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural
      persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National
      authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate
      and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry
      out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nRapid
      technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for
      the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of
      personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies
      and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale
      in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal
      information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both
      the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of
      personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international
      organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data.\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nThose
      developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in
      the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the
      trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market.
      Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical
      certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should
      be enhanced.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nWhere this Regulation provides for specifications
      or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far
      as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible
      to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into
      their national law.\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nThe objectives and principles of Directive
      95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation
      of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public
      perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons,
      in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection
      of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the
      protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data
      in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the
      Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit
      of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede
      authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such
      a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences
      in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons
      and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the
      level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard
      to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent
      and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal
      data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal
      data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried
      out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
      the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national
      provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation.
      In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing
      Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas
      that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of
      manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing
      of special categories of personal data (\u2018sensitive data\u2019). To that
      extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the
      circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more
      precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nEffective
      protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening
      and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations
      of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well
      as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for
      the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in
      the Member States.\\n\\n(12)\\n\\nArticle 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament
      and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural
      persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating
      to the free movement of personal data.\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nIn order to ensure a consistent
      level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent
      divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal
      market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency
      for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally
      enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and
      processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data,
      and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation
      between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning
      of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within
      the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection
      of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account
      of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this
      Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees
      with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies,
      and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take
      account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in
      the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized
      enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation
      2003/361/EC (5).\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nThe protection afforded by this Regulation should
      apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence,
      in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not
      cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular
      undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of
      the legal person and the contact details of the legal person.\\n\\n(15)\\n\\nIn
      order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of
      natural persons should be technologically neutral and should not depend on the
      techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing
      of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the
      personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system.
      Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured
      according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.\\n\\n(16)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and
      freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall
      outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security.
      This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member
      States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security
      policy of the Union.\\n\\n(17)\\n\\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European
      Parliament and of the Council (6) applies to the processing of personal data
      by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No
      45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal
      data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this Regulation
      and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and
      coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of
      Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should follow after the adoption of this Regulation,
      in order to allow application at the same time as this Regulation.\\n\\n(18)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person
      in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection
      to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or household activities could
      include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and
      online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this
      Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for
      processing personal data for such personal or household activities.\\n\\n(19)\\n\\nThe
      protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
      by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation,
      detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security
      and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal
      act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for
      those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under
      this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more
      specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (7). Member States may entrust competent authorities within
      the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily
      carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or
      prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including
      the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that
      the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is
      within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation.\\n\\nWith
      regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for
      purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able
      to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of
      the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific
      requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities
      for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational
      and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing
      of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation,
      this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific
      conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction
      constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
      safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention,
      investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution
      of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention
      of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework
      of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories.\\n\\n(20)\\n\\nWhile
      this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial
      authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations
      and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by
      courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory authorities
      should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their
      judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in
      the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision-making. It should
      be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific
      bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular
      ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among
      members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle
      complaints in relation to such data processing operations.\\n\\n(21)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of
      the European Parliament and of the Council (8), in particular of the liability
      rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive.
      That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal
      market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between
      Member States.\\n\\n(22)\\n\\nAny processing of personal data in the context
      of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the
      Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of
      whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies
      the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The
      legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with
      a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect.\\n\\n(23)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which
      they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of
      data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established
      in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities
      are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective
      of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller
      or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union,
      it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor
      envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in
      the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or
      an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact
      details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where
      the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention,
      factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or
      more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that
      other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union,
      may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services
      to data subjects in the Union.\\n\\n(24)\\n\\nThe processing of personal data
      of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established
      in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to
      the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour
      takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity
      can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained
      whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent
      use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural
      person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for
      analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\\n\\n(25)\\n\\nWhere
      Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation
      should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a
      Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post.\\n\\n(26)\\n\\nThe principles
      of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified
      or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation,
      which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information
      should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To
      determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken
      of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either
      by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly
      or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to
      identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors,
      such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking
      into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and
      technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore
      not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate
      to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered
      anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.
      This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous
      information, including for statistical or research purposes.\\n\\n(27)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States
      may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased
      persons.\\n\\n(28)\\n\\nThe application of pseudonymisation to personal data
      can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and
      processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction
      of \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 in this Regulation is not intended to preclude
      any other measures of data protection.\\n\\n(29)\\n\\nIn order to create incentives
      to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymisation
      should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller
      when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary
      to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented,
      and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific
      data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data
      should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller.\\n\\n(30)\\n\\nNatural
      persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices,
      applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie
      identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.
      This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers
      and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles
      of the natural persons and identify them.\\n\\n(31)\\n\\nPublic authorities
      to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for
      the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities,
      financial investigation units, independent administrative authorities, or financial
      market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities
      markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which
      are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in
      accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent
      by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional
      and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection
      of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities
      should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes
      of the processing.\\n\\n(32)\\n\\nConsent should be given by a clear affirmative
      act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication
      of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating
      to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means,
      or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet
      website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another
      statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's
      acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence,
      pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent
      should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes.
      When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of
      them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic
      means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to
      the use of the service for which it is provided.\\n\\n(33)\\n\\nIt is often
      not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific
      research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should
      be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when
      in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects
      should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research
      or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose.\\n\\n(34)\\n\\nGenetic
      data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired
      genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of
      a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal,
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the
      analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained.\\n\\n(35)\\n\\nPersonal
      data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status
      of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or
      future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information
      about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or
      the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU
      of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) to that natural person; a
      number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify
      the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing
      or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including from genetic data
      and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability,
      disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical
      state of the data subject independent of its source, for example from a physician
      or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic
      test.\\n\\n(36)\\n\\nThe main establishment of a controller in the Union should
      be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions
      on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another
      establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment
      should be considered to be the main establishment. The main establishment of
      a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria
      and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining
      the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable
      arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of
      personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical
      means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities
      do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not
      determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the
      processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or,
      if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing
      activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and
      the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory
      authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment,
      but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a
      supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate
      in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the
      supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor
      has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities
      concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing
      is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling
      undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of
      undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined
      by another undertaking.\\n\\n(37)\\n\\nA group of undertakings should cover
      a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling
      undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over
      the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation
      or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules
      implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in
      undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings,
      as a group of undertakings.\\n\\n(38)\\n\\nChildren merit specific protection
      with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks,
      consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing
      of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the
      use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality
      or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children
      when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of
      parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive
      or counselling services offered directly to a child.\\n\\n(39)\\n\\nAny processing
      of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural
      persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or
      otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.
      The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication
      relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy
      to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns,
      in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller
      and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and
      transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their
      right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them
      which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules,
      safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how
      to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the
      specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and
      legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data.
      The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
      for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular,
      ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to
      a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the
      processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure
      that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should
      be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every
      reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate
      are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that
      ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including
      for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment
      used for the processing.\\n\\n(40)\\n\\nIn order for processing to be lawful,
      personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject
      concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation
      or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including
      the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data
      subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject
      prior to entering into a contract.\\n\\n(41)\\n\\nWhere this Regulation refers
      to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require
      a legislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements
      pursuant to the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However,
      such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its
      application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with
      the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u2018Court
      of Justice\u2019) and the European Court of Human Rights.\\n\\n(42)\\n\\nWhere
      processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be
      able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing
      operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on another
      matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact
      that and the extent to which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive
      93/13/EEC (10) a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should
      be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain
      language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed,
      the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller
      and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.
      Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine
      or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\\n\\n(43)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid
      legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there
      is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular
      where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that
      consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation.
      Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent
      to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being
      appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including
      the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent
      not being necessary for such performance.\\n\\n(44)\\n\\nProcessing should be
      lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to
      enter into a contract.\\n\\n(45)\\n\\nWhere processing is carried out in accordance
      with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis
      in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law
      for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations
      based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also
      be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore,
      that law could specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the
      lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining
      the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing,
      the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be
      disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to
      ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State
      law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the
      public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public
      authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where
      it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as
      public health and social protection and the management of health care services,
      by private law, such as a professional association.\\n\\n(46)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary
      to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or
      that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital
      interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where
      the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types
      of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital
      interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for
      humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or
      in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural
      and man-made disasters.\\n\\n(47)\\n\\nThe legitimate interests of a controller,
      including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed,
      or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that
      the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are
      not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data
      subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest
      could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship
      between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the
      data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the
      existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether
      a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection
      of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests
      and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the
      interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances
      where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that
      it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities
      to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing
      by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal
      data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes
      a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal
      data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate
      interest.\\n\\n(48)\\n\\nControllers that are part of a group of undertakings
      or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest
      in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal
      administrative purposes, including the processing of clients' or employees'
      personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal data, within
      a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain
      unaffected.\\n\\n(49)\\n\\nThe processing of personal data to the extent strictly
      necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information
      security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist,
      at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions
      that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality
      of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services
      offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities,
      by computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response
      teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and services
      and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate
      interest of the data controller concerned. This could, for example, include
      preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious
      code distribution and stopping \u2018denial of service\u2019 attacks and damage
      to computer and electronic communication systems.\\n\\n(50)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were
      initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible
      with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such
      a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the
      personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance
      of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
      authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine
      and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be
      regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations.
      The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of
      personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order
      to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the
      purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller,
      after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing,
      should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the
      purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal
      data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data
      subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further
      use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further
      processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in
      both the original and intended further processing operations.\\n\\nWhere the
      data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member
      State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic
      society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public
      interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data
      irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application
      of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular the information
      of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including
      the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or
      threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal
      data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act
      or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as
      being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmission
      in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal
      data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal,
      professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.\\n\\n(51)\\n\\nPersonal
      data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental
      rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing
      could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those
      personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,
      whereby the use of the term \u2018racial origin\u2019 in this Regulation does
      not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine
      the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should
      not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal
      data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed
      through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication
      of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing
      is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account
      that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in
      order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance
      with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the
      public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
      In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles
      and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the
      conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for
      processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided,
      inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect
      of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course
      of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose
      of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n(52)\\n\\nDerogating
      from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should
      also be allowed when provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to
      suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights,
      where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal
      data in the field of employment law, social protection law including pensions
      and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control
      of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a derogation
      may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management
      of health-care services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness
      of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the
      health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should
      also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment,
      exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative
      or out-of-court procedure.\\n\\n(53)\\n\\nSpecial categories of personal data
      which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes
      only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons
      and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health
      or social care services and systems, including processing by the management
      and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality
      control, management information and the general national and local supervision
      of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social
      care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes,
      or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has
      to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in
      the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation
      should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories
      of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular
      where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related
      purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union
      or Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as
      to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons.
      Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions,
      including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric
      data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow
      of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border
      processing of such data.\\n\\n(54)\\n\\nThe processing of special categories
      of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas
      of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should
      be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons. In that context, \u2018public health\u2019 should
      be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (11), namely all elements related to health, namely health
      status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect
      on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care,
      the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care
      expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data
      concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal
      data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or
      insurance and banking companies.\\n\\n(55)\\n\\nMoreover, the processing of
      personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims,
      laid down by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially
      recognised religious associations, is carried out on grounds of public interest.\\n\\n(56)\\n\\nWhere
      in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system
      in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's
      political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons
      of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.\\n\\n(57)\\n\\nIf
      the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to
      identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire
      additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose
      of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller
      should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject
      in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. Identification should
      include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication
      mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to
      the on-line service offered by the data controller.\\n\\n(58)\\n\\nThe principle
      of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to
      the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that
      clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation
      be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example,
      when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance
      in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity
      of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether,
      by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being
      collected, such as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit
      specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is
      addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the
      child can easily understand.\\n\\n(59)\\n\\nModalities should be provided for
      facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation,
      including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge,
      in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the
      exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for
      requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed
      by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests
      from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month
      and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any
      such requests.\\n\\n(60)\\n\\nThe principles of fair and transparent processing
      require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing
      operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with
      any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing
      taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal
      data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the
      existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal
      data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed
      whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences,
      where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided
      in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible,
      intelligible and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the intended
      processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be machine-readable.\\n\\n(61)\\n\\nThe
      information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data
      subject should be given to him or her at the time of collection from the data
      subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source, within
      a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal
      data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should
      be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where
      the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than
      that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject
      prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and
      other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be
      provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general
      information should be provided.\\n\\n(62)\\n\\nHowever, it is not necessary
      to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already
      possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal
      data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to
      the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate
      effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried
      out for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of data
      subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should
      be taken into consideration.\\n\\n(63)\\n\\nA data subject should have the right
      of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her,
      and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be
      aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. This includes the right
      for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example
      the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses,
      examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or
      interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to
      know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for
      which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the
      personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic
      involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based
      on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller
      should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide
      the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right
      should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade
      secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting
      the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal
      to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes
      a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller
      should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data
      subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request
      relates.\\n\\n(64)\\n\\nThe controller should use all reasonable measures to
      verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in
      the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not
      retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential
      requests.\\n\\n(65)\\n\\nA data subject should have the right to have personal
      data concerning him or her rectified and a \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019
      where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member
      State law to which the controller is subject. In particular, a data subject
      should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer
      processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
      purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject
      has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data
      concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does
      not otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular
      where the data subject has given his or her consent as a child and is not fully
      aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such
      personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to
      exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child.
      However, the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it
      is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information,
      for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried
      out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
      the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health,
      for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence
      of legal claims.\\n\\n(66)\\n\\nTo strengthen the right to be forgotten in the
      online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way
      that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to
      inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any
      links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In doing so, that
      controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology
      and the means available to the controller, including technical measures, to
      inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subject's
      request.\\n\\n(67)\\n\\nMethods by which to restrict the processing of personal
      data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the selected data to another
      processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or
      temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems,
      the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means
      in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing
      operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data
      is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system.\\n\\n(68)\\n\\nTo further
      strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal
      data is carried out by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed
      to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided
      to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable
      format, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be
      encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. That
      right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the
      basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance
      of a contract. It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground
      other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be
      exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their
      public duties. It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal
      data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data
      subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should
      not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing
      systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal
      data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal
      data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects
      in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice
      the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the
      limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular,
      not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have
      been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent
      that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance
      of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the
      right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to
      another.\\n\\n(69)\\n\\nWhere personal data might lawfully be processed because
      processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
      interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller,
      or on grounds of the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party,
      a data subject should, nevertheless, be entitled to object to the processing
      of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should
      be for the controller to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest
      overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\\n\\n(70)\\n\\nWhere
      personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject
      should have the right to object to such processing, including profiling to the
      extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether with regard to initial
      or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That right should be
      explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly
      and separately from any other information.\\n\\n(71)\\n\\nThe data subject should
      have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure,
      evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on
      automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her
      or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of
      an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention.
      Such processing includes \u2018profiling\u2019 that consists of any form of
      automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating
      to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning
      the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
      preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where
      it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects
      him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling,
      should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to
      which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring
      and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards
      and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to
      ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller,
      or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data
      subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit
      consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards,
      which should include specific information to the data subject and the right
      to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain
      an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge
      the decision. Such measure should not concern a child.\\n\\nIn order to ensure
      fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into
      account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are
      processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical
      procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures
      appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies
      in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal
      data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the
      interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory
      effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political
      opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status
      or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect. Automated
      decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should
      be allowed only under specific conditions.\\n\\n(72)\\n\\nProfiling is subject
      to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such
      as the legal grounds for processing or data protection principles. The European
      Data Protection Board established by this Regulation (the \u2018Board\u2019)
      should be able to issue guidance in that context.\\n\\n(73)\\n\\nRestrictions
      concerning specific principles and the rights of information, access to and
      rectification or erasure of personal data, the right to data portability, the
      right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the communication
      of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations
      of the controllers may be imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessary
      and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard public security, including
      the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade disasters,
      the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution
      of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention
      of threats to public security, or of breaches of ethics for regulated professions,
      other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member
      State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union
      or of a Member State, the keeping of public registers kept for reasons of general
      public interest, further processing of archived personal data to provide specific
      information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state
      regimes or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of
      others, including social protection, public health and humanitarian purposes.
      Those restrictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in
      the Charter and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
      and Fundamental Freedoms.\\n\\n(74)\\n\\nThe responsibility and liability of
      the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller
      or on the controller's behalf should be established. In particular, the controller
      should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able
      to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation,
      including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into
      account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk
      to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(75)\\n\\nThe risk to the
      rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity,
      may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material
      or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to
      discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation,
      loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy,
      unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic
      or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights
      and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data;
      where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin, political
      opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the
      processing of genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life
      or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures; where personal
      aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting aspects concerning
      performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests,
      reliability or behaviour, location or movements, in order to create or use personal
      profiles; where personal data of vulnerable natural persons, in particular of
      children, are processed; or where processing involves a large amount of personal
      data and affects a large number of data subjects.\\n\\n(76)\\n\\nThe likelihood
      and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should
      be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
      processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment,
      by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk
      or a high risk.\\n\\n(77)\\n\\nGuidance on the implementation of appropriate
      measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor,
      especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing,
      their assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the
      identification of best practices to mitigate the risk, could be provided in
      particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications, guidelines
      provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer.
      The Board may also issue guidelines on processing operations that are considered
      to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons and indicate what measures may be sufficient in such cases to address
      such risk.\\n\\n(78)\\n\\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons with regard to the processing of personal data require that appropriate
      technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements
      of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with
      this Regulation, the controller should adopt internal policies and implement
      measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design
      and data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of
      minimising the processing of personal data, pseudonymising personal data as
      soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and processing of
      personal data, enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing, enabling
      the controller to create and improve security features. When developing, designing,
      selecting and using applications, services and products that are based on the
      processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers
      of the products, services and applications should be encouraged to take into
      account the right to data protection when developing and designing such products,
      services and applications and, with due regard to the state of the art, to make
      sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection
      obligations. The principles of data protection by design and by default should
      also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders.\\n\\n(79)\\n\\nThe
      protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility
      and liability of controllers and processors, also in relation to the monitoring
      by and measures of supervisory authorities, requires a clear allocation of the
      responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines
      the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where
      a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller.\\n\\n(80)\\n\\nWhere
      a controller or a processor not established in the Union is processing personal
      data of data subjects who are in the Union whose processing activities are related
      to the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the
      data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union, or to the monitoring
      of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union, the
      controller or the processor should designate a representative, unless the processing
      is occasional, does not include processing, on a large scale, of special categories
      of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions
      and offences, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes
      of the processing or if the controller is a public authority or body. The representative
      should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed
      by any supervisory authority. The representative should be explicitly designated
      by a written mandate of the controller or of the processor to act on its behalf
      with regard to its obligations under this Regulation. The designation of such
      a representative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller
      or of the processor under this Regulation. Such a representative should perform
      its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller or processor,
      including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard
      to any action taken to ensure compliance with this Regulation. The designated
      representative should be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of
      non-compliance by the controller or processor.\\n\\n(81)\\n\\nTo ensure compliance
      with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be
      carried out by the processor on behalf of the controller, when entrusting a
      processor with processing activities, the controller should use only processors
      providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms of expert knowledge,
      reliability and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures
      which will meet the requirements of this Regulation, including for the security
      of processing. The adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct
      or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate
      compliance with the obligations of the controller. The carrying-out of processing
      by a processor should be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union
      or Member State law, binding the processor to the controller, setting out the
      subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the
      processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects, taking
      into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the processor in the
      context of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms
      of the data subject. The controller and processor may choose to use an individual
      contract or standard contractual clauses which are adopted either directly by
      the Commission or by a supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency
      mechanism and then adopted by the Commission. After the completion of the processing
      on behalf of the controller, the processor should, at the choice of the controller,
      return or delete the personal data, unless there is a requirement to store the
      personal data under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject.\\n\\n(82)\\n\\nIn
      order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor
      should maintain records of processing activities under its responsibility. Each
      controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory
      authority and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might
      serve for monitoring those processing operations.\\n\\n(83)\\n\\nIn order to
      maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation,
      the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing
      and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. Those measures
      should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking
      into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation
      to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing
      data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented
      by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
      alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted,
      stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical, material
      or non-material damage.\\n\\n(84)\\n\\nIn order to enhance compliance with this
      Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible
      for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment to evaluate, in
      particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that risk. The
      outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the
      appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing
      of personal data complies with this Regulation. Where a data-protection impact
      assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the
      controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology
      and costs of implementation, a consultation of the supervisory authority should
      take place prior to the processing.\\n\\n(85)\\n\\nA personal data breach may,
      if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material
      or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their
      personal data or limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft
      or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage
      to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional
      secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural
      person concerned. Therefore, as soon as the controller becomes aware that a
      personal data breach has occurred, the controller should notify the personal
      data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible,
      not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the controller
      is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that
      the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons. Where such notification cannot be achieved within 72 hours,
      the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification and information
      may be provided in phases without undue further delay.\\n\\n(86)\\n\\nThe controller
      should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach, without undue
      delay, where that personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to allow him or her to
      take the necessary precautions. The communication should describe the nature
      of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person
      concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects. Such communications to data
      subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation
      with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other
      relevant authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need
      to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication
      with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against
      continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication.\\n\\n(87)\\n\\nIt
      should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational
      measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data
      breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and
      the data subject. The fact that the notification was made without undue delay
      should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity
      of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the
      data subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory
      authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation.\\n\\n(88)\\n\\nIn
      setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the
      notification of personal data breaches, due consideration should be given to
      the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not personal data had
      been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting
      the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules
      and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law-enforcement
      authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation
      of the circumstances of a personal data breach.\\n\\n(89)\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC
      provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data
      to the supervisory authorities. While that obligation produces administrative
      and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection
      of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should
      therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms
      which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely
      to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue
      of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations
      may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or are of
      a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out
      before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the
      time that has elapsed since the initial processing.\\n\\n(90)\\n\\nIn such cases,
      a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller
      prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity
      of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes
      of the processing and the sources of the risk. That impact assessment should
      include, in particular, the measures, safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for
      mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating
      compliance with this Regulation.\\n\\n(91)\\n\\nThis should in particular apply
      to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount
      of personal data at regional, national or supranational level and which could
      affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high
      risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in accordance with
      the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a
      large scale as well as to other processing operations which result in a high
      risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular where those
      operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights.
      A data protection impact assessment should also be made where personal data
      are processed for taking decisions regarding specific natural persons following
      any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural
      persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special
      categories of personal data, biometric data, or data on criminal convictions
      and offences or related security measures. A data protection impact assessment
      is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale,
      especially when using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where
      the competent supervisory authority considers that the processing is likely
      to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular
      because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service
      or a contract, or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale.
      The processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale
      if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual
      physician, other health care professional or lawyer. In such cases, a data protection
      impact assessment should not be mandatory.\\n\\n(92)\\n\\nThere are circumstances
      under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection
      impact assessment to be broader than a single project, for example where public
      authorities or bodies intend to establish a common application or processing
      platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common application
      or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely
      used horizontal activity.\\n\\n(93)\\n\\nIn the context of the adoption of the
      Member State law on which the performance of the tasks of the public authority
      or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation
      or set of operations in question, Member States may deem it necessary to carry
      out such assessment prior to the processing activities.\\n\\n(94)\\n\\nWhere
      a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in
      the absence of safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the
      risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and
      the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable
      means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation, the supervisory
      authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activities. Such
      high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent
      and frequency of processing, which may result also in a realisation of damage
      or interference with the rights and freedoms of the natural person. The supervisory
      authority should respond to the request for consultation within a specified
      period. However, the absence of a reaction of the supervisory authority within
      that period should be without prejudice to any intervention of the supervisory
      authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation,
      including the power to prohibit processing operations. As part of that consultation
      process, the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with
      regard to the processing at issue may be submitted to the supervisory authority,
      in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(95)\\n\\nThe processor should assist the
      controller, where necessary and upon request, in ensuring compliance with the
      obligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments
      and from prior consultation of the supervisory authority.\\n\\n(96)\\n\\nA consultation
      of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation
      of a legislative or regulatory measure which provides for the processing of
      personal data, in order to ensure compliance of the intended processing with
      this Regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data
      subject.\\n\\n(97)\\n\\nWhere the processing is carried out by a public authority,
      except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial
      capacity, where, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller
      whose core activities consist of processing operations that require regular
      and systematic monitoring of the data subjects on a large scale, or where the
      core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on
      a large scale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences, a person with expert knowledge of data protection
      law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor internal
      compliance with this Regulation. In the private sector, the core activities
      of a controller relate to its primary activities and do not relate to the processing
      of personal data as ancillary activities. The necessary level of expert knowledge
      should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations
      carried out and the protection required for the personal data processed by the
      controller or the processor. Such data protection officers, whether or not they
      are an employee of the controller, should be in a position to perform their
      duties and tasks in an independent manner.\\n\\n(98)\\n\\nAssociations or other
      bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged
      to draw up codes of conduct, within the limits of this Regulation, so as to
      facilitate the effective application of this Regulation, taking account of the
      specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and
      the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. In particular, such
      codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors,
      taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights
      and freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(99)\\n\\nWhen drawing up a code of conduct,
      or when amending or extending such a code, associations and other bodies representing
      categories of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders,
      including data subjects where feasible, and have regard to submissions received
      and views expressed in response to such consultations.\\n\\n(100)\\n\\nIn order
      to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment
      of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged,
      allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant
      products and services.\\n\\n(101)\\n\\nFlows of personal data to and from countries
      outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion
      of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in such flows
      has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal
      data. However, when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers,
      processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations,
      the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation
      should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal
      data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors
      in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any event,
      transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried
      out in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only
      if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid
      down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal
      data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by
      the controller or processor.\\n\\n(102)\\n\\nThis Regulation is without prejudice
      to international agreements concluded between the Union and third countries
      regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for
      the data subjects. Member States may conclude international agreements which
      involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations,
      as far as such agreements do not affect this Regulation or any other provisions
      of Union law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental
      rights of the data subjects.\\n\\n(103)\\n\\nThe Commission may decide with
      effect for the entire Union that a third country, a territory or specified sector
      within a third country, or an international organisation, offers an adequate
      level of data protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout
      the Union as regards the third country or international organisation which is
      considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers of
      personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place
      without the need to obtain any further authorisation. The Commission may also
      decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to
      the third country or international organisation, to revoke such a decision.\\n\\n(104)\\n\\nIn
      line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular
      the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its assessment of
      the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third country,
      take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access
      to justice as well as international human rights norms and standards and its
      general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security,
      defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The
      adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector
      in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria, such
      as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards
      and legislation in force in the third country. The third country should offer
      guarantees ensuring an adequate level of protection essentially equivalent to
      that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are processed
      in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the third country should
      ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide
      for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data protection authorities,
      and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights
      and effective administrative and judicial redress.\\n\\n(105)\\n\\nApart from
      the international commitments the third country or international organisation
      has entered into, the Commission should take account of obligations arising
      from the third country's or international organisation's participation in multilateral
      or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal
      data, as well as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the
      third country's accession to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January
      1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing
      of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be taken into account. The
      Commission should consult the Board when assessing the level of protection in
      third countries or international organisations.\\n\\n(106)\\n\\nThe Commission
      should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a
      third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an
      international organisation, and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted
      on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its
      adequacy decisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism
      of their functioning. That periodic review should be conducted in consultation
      with the third country or international organisation in question and take into
      account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation.
      For the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the
      Commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the European
      Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources.
      The Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of
      the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the Committee within
      the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of
      the Council (12) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament
      and to the Council.\\n\\n(107)\\n\\nThe Commission may recognise that a third
      country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international
      organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently
      the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation
      should be prohibited, unless the requirements in this Regulation relating to
      transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules,
      and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision
      should be made for consultations between the Commission and such third countries
      or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely manner, inform
      the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into
      consultations with it in order to remedy the situation.\\n\\n(108)\\n\\nIn the
      absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor should take measures
      to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate
      safeguards for the data subject. Such appropriate safeguards may consist of
      making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted
      by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory
      authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority. Those
      safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the
      rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including
      the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies,
      including to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim
      compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular
      to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing,
      the principles of data protection by design and by default. Transfers may also
      be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies
      in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties
      or functions, including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative
      arrangements, such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable
      and effective rights for data subjects. Authorisation by the competent supervisory
      authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative
      arrangements that are not legally binding.\\n\\n(109)\\n\\nThe possibility for
      the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopted
      by the Commission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or
      processors neither from including the standard data-protection clauses in a
      wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another processor,
      nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do
      not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted
      by the Commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental
      rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors should be
      encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that
      supplement standard protection clauses.\\n\\n(110)\\n\\nA group of undertakings,
      or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, should be able
      to make use of approved binding corporate rules for its international transfers
      from the Union to organisations within the same group of undertakings, or group
      of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, provided that such corporate
      rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate
      safeguards for transfers or categories of transfers of personal data.\\n\\n(111)\\n\\nProvisions
      should be made for the possibility for transfers in certain circumstances where
      the data subject has given his or her explicit consent, where the transfer is
      occasional and necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim, regardless
      of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any out-of-court
      procedure, including procedures before regulatory bodies. Provision should also
      be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds of public
      interest laid down by Union or Member State law so require or where the transfer
      is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by
      the public or persons having a legitimate interest. In the latter case, such
      a transfer should not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories
      of the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for
      consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be
      made only at the request of those persons or, if they are to be the recipients,
      taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject.\\n\\n(112)\\n\\nThose
      derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary
      for important reasons of public interest, for example in cases of international
      data exchange between competition authorities, tax or customs administrations,
      between financial supervisory authorities, between services competent for social
      security matters, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing
      for contagious diseases or in order to reduce and/or eliminate doping in sport.
      A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary
      to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's or another
      person's vital interests, including physical integrity or life, if the data
      subject is incapable of giving consent. In the absence of an adequacy decision,
      Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly
      set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country
      or an international organisation. Member States should notify such provisions
      to the Commission. Any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation
      of personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of
      giving consent, with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva
      Conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law applicable in
      armed conflicts, could be considered to be necessary for an important reason
      of public interest or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject.\\n\\n(113)\\n\\nTransfers
      which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number
      of data subjects, could also be possible for the purposes of the compelling
      legitimate interests pursued by the controller, when those interests are not
      overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when
      the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer.
      The controller should give particular consideration to the nature of the personal
      data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations,
      as well as the situation in the country of origin, the third country and the
      country of final destination, and should provide suitable safeguards to protect
      fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing
      of their personal data. Such transfers should be possible only in residual cases
      where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, the legitimate expectations
      of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into consideration.
      The controller should inform the supervisory authority and the data subject
      about the transfer.\\n\\n(114)\\n\\nIn any case, where the Commission has taken
      no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third country, the
      controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects
      with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing of their data
      in the Union once those data have been transferred so that that they will continue
      to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards.\\n\\n(115)\\n\\nSome third
      countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly
      regulate the processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction
      of the Member States. This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions
      of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor
      to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international
      agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting
      third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application
      of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international
      law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured
      in the Union by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the
      conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This
      may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important
      ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the
      controller is subject.\\n\\n(116)\\n\\nWhen personal data moves across borders
      outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons
      to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from
      the unlawful use or disclosure of that information. At the same time, supervisory
      authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations
      relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together
      in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative
      or remedial powers, inconsistent legal regimes, and practical obstacles like
      resource constraints. Therefore, there is a need to promote closer cooperation
      among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information
      and carry out investigations with their international counterparts. For the
      purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate and
      provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for
      the protection of personal data, the Commission and the supervisory authorities
      should exchange information and cooperate in activities related to the exercise
      of their powers with competent authorities in third countries, based on reciprocity
      and in accordance with this Regulation.\\n\\n(117)\\n\\nThe establishment of
      supervisory authorities in Member States, empowered to perform their tasks and
      exercise their powers with complete independence, is an essential component
      of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their
      personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one supervisory
      authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative
      structure.\\n\\n(118)\\n\\nThe independence of supervisory authorities should
      not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject to control or monitoring
      mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review.\\n\\n(119)\\n\\nWhere
      a Member State establishes several supervisory authorities, it should establish
      by law mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of those supervisory
      authorities in the consistency mechanism. That Member State should in particular
      designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point
      for the effective participation of those authorities in the mechanism, to ensure
      swift and smooth cooperation with other supervisory authorities, the Board and
      the Commission.\\n\\n(120)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority should be provided
      with the financial and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary
      for the effective performance of their tasks, including those related to mutual
      assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the
      Union. Each supervisory authority should have a separate, public annual budget,
      which may be part of the overall state or national budget.\\n\\n(121)\\n\\nThe
      general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority should
      be laid down by law in each Member State and should in particular provide that
      those members are to be appointed, by means of a transparent procedure, either
      by the parliament, government or the head of State of the Member State on the
      basis of a proposal from the government, a member of the government, the parliament
      or a chamber of the parliament, or by an independent body entrusted under Member
      State law. In order to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority,
      the member or members should act with integrity, refrain from any action that
      is incompatible with their duties and should not, during their term of office,
      engage in any incompatible occupation, whether gainful or not. The supervisory
      authority should have its own staff, chosen by the supervisory authority or
      an independent body established by Member State law, which should be subject
      to the exclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority.\\n\\n(122)\\n\\nEach
      supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own Member
      State to exercise the powers and to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance
      with this Regulation. This should cover in particular the processing in the
      context of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor
      on the territory of its own Member State, the processing of personal data carried
      out by public authorities or private bodies acting in the public interest, processing
      affecting data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller
      or processor not established in the Union when targeting data subjects residing
      on its territory. This should include handling complaints lodged by a data subject,
      conducting investigations on the application of this Regulation and promoting
      public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the
      processing of personal data.\\n\\n(123)\\n\\nThe supervisory authorities should
      monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and contribute
      to its consistent application throughout the Union, in order to protect natural
      persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate
      the free flow of personal data within the internal market. For that purpose,
      the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the Commission,
      without the need for any agreement between Member States on the provision of
      mutual assistance or on such cooperation.\\n\\n(124)\\n\\nWhere the processing
      of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment
      of a controller or a processor in the Union and the controller or processor
      is established in more than one Member State, or where processing taking place
      in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or
      processor in the Union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect
      data subjects in more than one Member State, the supervisory authority for the
      main establishment of the controller or processor or for the single establishment
      of the controller or processor should act as lead authority. It should cooperate
      with the other authorities concerned, because the controller or processor has
      an establishment on the territory of their Member State, because data subjects
      residing on their territory are substantially affected, or because a complaint
      has been lodged with them. Also where a data subject not residing in that Member
      State has lodged a complaint, the supervisory authority with which such complaint
      has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority concerned. Within its
      tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this Regulation,
      the Board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to
      be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the processing in question
      substantially affects data subjects in more than one Member State and on what
      constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection.\\n\\n(125)\\n\\nThe lead authority
      should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the
      powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. In its capacity as
      lead authority, the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate
      the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process. Where
      the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part,
      that decision should be adopted by the supervisory authority with which the
      complaint has been lodged.\\n\\n(126)\\n\\nThe decision should be agreed jointly
      by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned
      and should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller
      or processor and be binding on the controller and processor. The controller
      or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this
      Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory
      authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards
      the processing activities in the Union.\\n\\n(127)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority
      not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local
      cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member
      State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing
      carried out in a single Member State and involves only data subjects in that
      single Member State, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing
      of employees' personal data in the specific employment context of a Member State.
      In such cases, the supervisory authority should inform the lead supervisory
      authority without delay about the matter. After being informed, the lead supervisory
      authority should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision
      on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory
      authorities concerned (\u2018one-stop-shop mechanism\u2019), or whether the
      supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level.
      When deciding whether it will handle the case, the lead supervisory authority
      should take into account whether there is an establishment of the controller
      or processor in the Member State of the supervisory authority which informed
      it in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-\xE0-vis the controller
      or processor. Where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case,
      the supervisory authority which informed it should have the possibility to submit
      a draft for a decision, of which the lead supervisory authority should take
      utmost account when preparing its draft decision in that one-stop-shop mechanism.\\n\\n(128)\\n\\nThe
      rules on the lead supervisory authority and the one-stop-shop mechanism should
      not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities or private
      bodies in the public interest. In such cases the only supervisory authority
      competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this Regulation
      should be the supervisory authority of the Member State where the public authority
      or private body is established.\\n\\n(129)\\n\\nIn order to ensure consistent
      monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory
      authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers,
      including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and authorisation
      and advisory powers, in particular in cases of complaints from natural persons,
      and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under Member
      State law, to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the
      judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings. Such powers should also
      include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation, including
      a ban, on processing. Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection
      of personal data under this Regulation. The powers of supervisory authorities
      should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set
      out in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable
      time. In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate
      in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the
      circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person to
      be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely
      is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons
      concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised
      in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such
      as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding
      measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous,
      indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure, the date of
      issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of the supervisory
      authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer
      to the right of an effective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements
      pursuant to Member State procedural law. The adoption of a legally binding decision
      implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the
      supervisory authority that adopted the decision.\\n\\n(130)\\n\\nWhere the supervisory
      authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory
      authority, the lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the
      supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged in accordance
      with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this Regulation.
      In such cases, the lead supervisory authority should, when taking measures intended
      to produce legal effects, including the imposition of administrative fines,
      take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority with which the
      complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any
      investigation on the territory of its own Member State in liaison with the competent
      supervisory authority.\\n\\n(131)\\n\\nWhere another supervisory authority should
      act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of the controller
      or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible
      infringement concerns only processing activities of the controller or processor
      in the Member State where the complaint has been lodged or the possible infringement
      detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to substantially
      affect data subjects in other Member States, the supervisory authority receiving
      a complaint or detecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail
      possible infringements of this Regulation should seek an amicable settlement
      with the controller and, if this proves unsuccessful, exercise its full range
      of powers. This should include: specific processing carried out in the territory
      of the Member State of the supervisory authority or with regard to data subjects
      on the territory of that Member State; processing that is carried out in the
      context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects
      in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority; or processing
      that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal obligations under
      Member State law.\\n\\n(132)\\n\\nAwareness-raising activities by supervisory
      authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures directed
      at controllers and processors, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      as well as natural persons in particular in the educational context.\\n\\n(133)\\n\\nThe
      supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and
      provide mutual assistance, so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement
      of this Regulation in the internal market. A supervisory authority requesting
      mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response
      to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request
      by the other supervisory authority.\\n\\n(134)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority
      should, where appropriate, participate in joint operations with other supervisory
      authorities. The requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond
      to the request within a specified time period.\\n\\n(135)\\n\\nIn order to ensure
      the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency
      mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established.
      That mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends
      to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations
      which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several
      Member States. It should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned
      or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency
      mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the
      Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties.\\n\\n(136)\\n\\nIn
      applying the consistency mechanism, the Board should, within a determined period
      of time, issue an opinion, if a majority of its members so decides or if so
      requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission. The Board
      should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are
      disputes between supervisory authorities. For that purpose, it should issue,
      in principle by a two-thirds majority of its members, legally binding decisions
      in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory
      authorities, in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory
      authority and supervisory authorities concerned on the merits of the case, in
      particular whether there is an infringement of this Regulation.\\n\\n(137)\\n\\nThere
      may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of
      data subjects, in particular when the danger exists that the enforcement of
      a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded. A supervisory authority
      should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its
      territory with a specified period of validity which should not exceed three
      months.\\n\\n(138)\\n\\nThe application of such mechanism should be a condition
      for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce legal effects by a supervisory
      authority in those cases where its application is mandatory. In other cases
      of cross-border relevance, the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory
      authority and supervisory authorities concerned should be applied and mutual
      assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the supervisory
      authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering
      the consistency mechanism.\\n\\n(139)\\n\\nIn order to promote the consistent
      application of this Regulation, the Board should be set up as an independent
      body of the Union. To fulfil its objectives, the Board should have legal personality.
      The Board should be represented by its Chair. It should replace the Working
      Party on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal
      Data established by Directive 95/46/EC. It should consist of the head of a supervisory
      authority of each Member State and the European Data Protection Supervisor or
      their respective representatives. The Commission should participate in the Board's
      activities without voting rights and the European Data Protection Supervisor
      should have specific voting rights. The Board should contribute to the consistent
      application of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by advising the
      Commission, in particular on the level of protection in third countries or international
      organisations, and promoting cooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout
      the Union. The Board should act independently when performing its tasks.\\n\\n(140)\\n\\nThe
      Board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the European Data Protection
      Supervisor. The staff of the European Data Protection Supervisor involved in
      carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this Regulation should perform
      its tasks exclusively under the instructions of, and report to, the Chair of
      the Board.\\n\\n(141)\\n\\nEvery data subject should have the right to lodge
      a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in the Member
      State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial
      remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter if the data subject considers
      that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed or where the supervisory
      authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses
      a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights
      of the data subject. The investigation following a complaint should be carried
      out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific
      case. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress
      and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires
      further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate
      information should be given to the data subject. In order to facilitate the
      submission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such
      as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically,
      without excluding other means of communication.\\n\\n(142)\\n\\nWhere a data
      subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed,
      he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation
      or association which is constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State,
      has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the
      field of the protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her
      behalf with a supervisory authority, exercise the right to a judicial remedy
      on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise
      the right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State
      may provide for such a body, organisation or association to have the right to
      lodge a complaint in that Member State, independently of a data subject's mandate,
      and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider
      that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing
      of personal data which infringes this Regulation. That body, organisation or
      association may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subject's behalf
      independently of the data subject's mandate.\\n\\n(143)\\n\\nAny natural or
      legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of
      the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article
      263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities concerned
      which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being
      notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the
      Board are of direct and individual concern to a controller, processor or complainant,
      the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within
      two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with
      Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each
      natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the
      competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which
      produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular
      the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory
      authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to
      an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory
      authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice
      provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority
      should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory
      authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member
      State's procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which
      should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant
      to the dispute before them.\\n\\nWhere a complaint has been rejected or dismissed
      by a supervisory authority, the complainant may bring proceedings before the
      courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating
      to the application of this Regulation, national courts which consider a decision
      on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment, may, or in the case
      provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the Court of Justice to give
      a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including this Regulation.
      Furthermore, where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision
      of the Board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision
      of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare
      the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the
      Court of Justice in accordance with Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court
      of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a national court
      may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the
      request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action
      for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was directly and individually
      concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down
      in Article 263 TFEU.\\n\\n(144)\\n\\nWhere a court seized of proceedings against
      a decision by a supervisory authority has reason to believe that proceedings
      concerning the same processing, such as the same subject matter as regards processing
      by the same controller or processor, or the same cause of action, are brought
      before a competent court in another Member State, it should contact that court
      in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings. If related proceedings
      are pending before a court in another Member State, any court other than the
      court first seized may stay its proceedings or may, on request of one of the
      parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seized if that court
      has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consolidation
      of such related proceedings. Proceedings are deemed to be related where they
      are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together
      in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate
      proceedings.\\n\\n(145)\\n\\nFor proceedings against a controller or processor,
      the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before the courts of
      the Member States where the controller or processor has an establishment or
      where the data subject resides, unless the controller is a public authority
      of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.\\n\\n(146)\\n\\nThe
      controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer
      as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or
      processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any
      way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted
      in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully
      reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any
      claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member
      State law. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing
      that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this
      Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data subjects
      should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered.
      Where controllers or processors are involved in the same processing, each controller
      or processor should be held liable for the entire damage. However, where they
      are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State
      law, compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each
      controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing, provided that
      full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the damage
      is ensured. Any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may
      subsequently institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors
      involved in the same processing.\\n\\n(147)\\n\\nWhere specific rules on jurisdiction
      are contained in this Regulation, in particular as regards proceedings seeking
      a judicial remedy including compensation, against a controller or processor,
      general jurisdiction rules such as those of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of
      the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should not prejudice the application
      of such specific rules.\\n\\n(148)\\n\\nIn order to strengthen the enforcement
      of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines should
      be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instead
      of appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this
      Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed
      would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand
      may be issued instead of a fine. Due regard should however be given to the nature,
      gravity and duration of the infringement, the intentional character of the infringement,
      actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any
      relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became
      known to the supervisory authority, compliance with measures ordered against
      the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating
      or mitigating factor. The imposition of penalties including administrative fines
      should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the
      general principles of Union law and the Charter, including effective judicial
      protection and due process.\\n\\n(149)\\n\\nMember States should be able to
      lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this Regulation,
      including for infringements of national rules adopted pursuant to and within
      the limits of this Regulation. Those criminal penalties may also allow for the
      deprivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this Regulation.
      However, the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national
      rules and of administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle
      of ne bis in idem, as interpreted by the Court of Justice.\\n\\n(150)\\n\\nIn
      order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements
      of this Regulation, each supervisory authority should have the power to impose
      administrative fines. This Regulation should indicate infringements and the
      upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which
      should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual
      case, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation,
      with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement
      and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the
      obligations under this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences
      of the infringement. Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking,
      an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with
      Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are
      imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the supervisory authority should
      take account of the general level of income in the Member State as well as the
      economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the
      fine. The consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application
      of administrative fines. It should be for the Member States to determine whether
      and to which extent public authorities should be subject to administrative fines.
      Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application
      of other powers of the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this
      Regulation.\\n\\n(151)\\n\\nThe legal systems of Denmark and Estonia do not
      allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The rules on administrative
      fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by
      competent national courts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed
      by the supervisory authority in the framework of a misdemeanour procedure, provided
      that such an application of the rules in those Member States has an equivalent
      effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. Therefore
      the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation by
      the supervisory authority initiating the fine. In any event, the fines imposed
      should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\\n\\n(152)\\n\\nWhere this
      Regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in
      other cases, for example in cases of serious infringements of this Regulation,
      Member States should implement a system which provides for effective, proportionate
      and dissuasive penalties. The nature of such penalties, criminal or administrative,
      should be determined by Member State law.\\n\\n(153)\\n\\nMember States law
      should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information,
      including journalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the
      right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The processing
      of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the purposes of academic,
      artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exemptions
      from certain provisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right
      to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and
      information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter. This should apply in
      particular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in
      news archives and press libraries. Therefore, Member States should adopt legislative
      measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose
      of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exemptions
      and derogations on general principles, the rights of the data subject, the controller
      and the processor, the transfer of personal data to third countries or international
      organisations, the independent supervisory authorities, cooperation and consistency,
      and specific data-processing situations. Where such exemptions or derogations
      differ from one Member State to another, the law of the Member State to which
      the controller is subject should apply. In order to take account of the importance
      of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary
      to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly.\\n\\n(154)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be
      taken into account when applying this Regulation. Public access to official
      documents may be considered to be in the public interest. Personal data in documents
      held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed
      by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member
      State law to which the public authority or public body is subject. Such laws
      should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse of public
      sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may
      therefore provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection
      of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The reference to public authorities
      and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered
      by Member State law on public access to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council (14) leaves intact and in no way affects
      the level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
      personal data under the provisions of Union and Member State law, and in particular
      does not alter the obligations and rights set out in this Regulation. In particular,
      that Directive should not apply to documents to which access is excluded or
      restricted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of protection of personal
      data, and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain
      personal data the re-use of which has been provided for by law as being incompatible
      with the law concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the
      processing of personal data.\\n\\n(155)\\n\\nMember State law or collective
      agreements, including \u2018works agreements\u2019, may provide for specific
      rules on the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context,
      in particular for the conditions under which personal data in the employment
      context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the purposes
      of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including
      discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management,
      planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace,
      health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment,
      on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment,
      and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship.\\n\\n(156)\\n\\nThe
      processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to
      appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant
      to this Regulation. Those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational
      measures are in place in order to ensure, in particular, the principle of data
      minimisation. The further processing of personal data for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility
      to fulfil those purposes by processing data which do not permit or no longer
      permit the identification of data subjects, provided that appropriate safeguards
      exist (such as, for instance, pseudonymisation of the data). Member States should
      provide for appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. Member States should be authorised to provide, under
      specific conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects,
      specifications and derogations with regard to the information requirements and
      rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgotten, to restriction of processing,
      to data portability, and to object when processing personal data for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. The conditions and safeguards in question may entail
      specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate
      in the light of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical
      and organisational measures aimed at minimising the processing of personal data
      in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles. The processing
      of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant
      legislation such as on clinical trials.\\n\\n(157)\\n\\nBy coupling information
      from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard
      to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and
      depression. On the basis of registries, research results can be enhanced, as
      they draw on a larger population. Within social science, research on the basis
      of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term
      correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education
      with other life conditions. Research results obtained through registries provide
      solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation
      and implementation of knowledge-based policy, improve the quality of life for
      a number of people and improve the efficiency of social services. In order to
      facilitate scientific research, personal data can be processed for scientific
      research purposes, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out
      in Union or Member State law.\\n\\n(158)\\n\\nWhere personal data are processed
      for archiving purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing,
      bearing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. Public
      authorities or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest
      should be services which, pursuant to Union or Member State law, have a legal
      obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote,
      disseminate and provide access to records of enduring value for general public
      interest. Member States should also be authorised to provide for the further
      processing of personal data for archiving purposes, for example with a view
      to providing specific information related to the political behaviour under former
      totalitarian state regimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, in particular
      the Holocaust, or war crimes.\\n\\n(159)\\n\\nWhere personal data are processed
      for scientific research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that
      processing. For the purposes of this Regulation, the processing of personal
      data for scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner
      including for example technological development and demonstration, fundamental
      research, applied research and privately funded research. In addition, it should
      take into account the Union's objective under Article 179(1) TFEU of achieving
      a European Research Area. Scientific research purposes should also include studies
      conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. To meet the specificities
      of processing personal data for scientific research purposes, specific conditions
      should apply in particular as regards the publication or otherwise disclosure
      of personal data in the context of scientific research purposes. If the result
      of scientific research in particular in the health context gives reason for
      further measures in the interest of the data subject, the general rules of this
      Regulation should apply in view of those measures.\\n\\n(160)\\n\\nWhere personal
      data are processed for historical research purposes, this Regulation should
      also apply to that processing. This should also include historical research
      and research for genealogical purposes, bearing in mind that this Regulation
      should not apply to deceased persons.\\n\\n(161)\\n\\nFor the purpose of consenting
      to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials, the
      relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (15) should apply.\\n\\n(162)\\n\\nWhere personal data are
      processed for statistical purposes, this Regulation should apply to that processing.
      Union or Member State law should, within the limits of this Regulation, determine
      statistical content, control of access, specifications for the processing of
      personal data for statistical purposes and appropriate measures to safeguard
      the rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality.
      Statistical purposes mean any operation of collection and the processing of
      personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical
      results. Those statistical results may further be used for different purposes,
      including a scientific research purpose. The statistical purpose implies that
      the result of processing for statistical purposes is not personal data, but
      aggregate data, and that this result or the personal data are not used in support
      of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person.\\n\\n(163)\\n\\nThe
      confidential information which the Union and national statistical authorities
      collect for the production of official European and official national statistics
      should be protected. European statistics should be developed, produced and disseminated
      in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in Article 338(2) TFEU,
      while national statistics should also comply with Member State law. Regulation
      (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) provides
      further specifications on statistical confidentiality for European statistics.\\n\\n(164)\\n\\nAs
      regards the powers of the supervisory authorities to obtain from the controller
      or processor access to personal data and access to their premises, Member States
      may adopt by law, within the limits of this Regulation, specific rules in order
      to safeguard the professional or other equivalent secrecy obligations, in so
      far as necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with
      an obligation of professional secrecy. This is without prejudice to existing
      Member State obligations to adopt rules on professional secrecy where required
      by Union law.\\n\\n(165)\\n\\nThis Regulation respects and does not prejudice
      the status under existing constitutional law of churches and religious associations
      or communities in the Member States, as recognised in Article 17 TFEU.\\n\\n(166)\\n\\nIn
      order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, namely to protect the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the
      protection of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal data
      within the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU
      should be delegated to the Commission. In particular, delegated acts should
      be adopted in respect of criteria and requirements for certification mechanisms,
      information to be presented by standardised icons and procedures for providing
      such icons. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate
      consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission,
      when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,
      timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament
      and to the Council.\\n\\n(167)\\n\\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for
      the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred
      on the Commission when provided for by this Regulation. Those powers should
      be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. In that context,
      the Commission should consider specific measures for micro, small and medium-sized
      enterprises.\\n\\n(168)\\n\\nThe examination procedure should be used for the
      adoption of implementing acts on standard contractual clauses between controllers
      and processors and between processors; codes of conduct; technical standards
      and mechanisms for certification; the adequate level of protection afforded
      by a third country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country,
      or an international organisation; standard protection clauses; formats and procedures
      for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers, processors
      and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules; mutual assistance;
      and arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between
      supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board.\\n\\n(169)\\n\\nThe
      Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where available
      evidence reveals that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within
      that third country, or an international organisation does not ensure an adequate
      level of protection, and imperative grounds of urgency so require.\\n\\n(170)\\n\\nSince
      the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection
      of natural persons and the free flow of personal data throughout the Union,
      cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason
      of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the
      Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as
      set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with
      the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation
      does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\\n\\n(171)\\n\\nDirective
      95/46/EC should be repealed by this Regulation. Processing already under way
      on the date of application of this Regulation should be brought into conformity
      with this Regulation within the period of two years after which this Regulation
      enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pursuant to Directive
      95/46/EC, it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent
      again if the manner in which the consent has been given is in line with the
      conditions of this Regulation, so as to allow the controller to continue such
      processing after the date of application of this Regulation. Commission decisions
      adopted and authorisations by supervisory authorities based on Directive 95/46/EC
      remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed.\\n\\n(172)\\n\\nThe European
      Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of
      Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 7 March 2012 (17).\\n\\n(173)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation should apply to all matters concerning the protection of fundamental
      rights and freedoms vis-\xE0-vis the processing of personal data which are not
      subject to specific obligations with the same objective set out in Directive
      2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), including the
      obligations on the controller and the rights of natural persons. In order to
      clarify the relationship between this Regulation and Directive 2002/58/EC, that
      Directive should be amended accordingly. Once this Regulation is adopted, Directive
      2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with
      this Regulation,\\n\\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nGeneral
      provisions\\n\\nArticle 1\\n\\nSubject-matter and objectives\\n\\n1. This Regulation
      lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to
      the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal
      data.\\n\\n2. This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural
      persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.\\n\\n3.
      The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted
      nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons
      with regard to the processing of personal data.\\n\\nArticle 2\\n\\nMaterial
      scope\\n\\n1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly

      5\\n\\nPrinciples relating to processing of personal data\\n\\n1. Personal data
      shall be:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nprocessed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner
      in relation to the data subject (\u2018lawfulness, fairness and transparency\u2019);\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ncollected
      for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in
      a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered
      to be incompatible with the initial purposes (\u2018purpose limitation\u2019);\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nadequate,
      relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
      they are processed (\u2018data minimisation\u2019);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\naccurate and,
      where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
      that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which
      they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (\u2018accuracy\u2019);\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nkept
      in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is
      necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal
      data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed
      solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject
      to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required
      by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data
      subject (\u2018storage limitation\u2019);\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessed in a manner
      that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
      against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction
      or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (\u2018integrity
      and confidentiality\u2019).\\n\\n2. The controller shall be responsible for,
      and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (\u2018accountability\u2019).\\n\\nArticle
      6\\n\\nLawfulness of processing\\n\\n1. Processing shall be lawful only if and
      to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data
      for one or more specific purposes;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for
      the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order
      to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary in order to protect the vital
      interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller
      or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests
      or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection
      of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\\n\\nPoint
      (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public
      authorities in the performance of their tasks.\\n\\n2. Member States may maintain
      or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules
      of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c)
      and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for
      the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including
      for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.\\n\\n3.
      The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1
      shall be laid down by:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nUnion law; or\\n</document_text>\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\"max_tokens\":4096,\"stream\":false,\"temperature\":0.3,\"top_p\":0.3}"

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual

      (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\\n\\nof 27 April
      2016\\n\\non the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing
      of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
      95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\\n\\n(Text with EEA relevance)\\n\\nTHE
      EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\\n\\nHaving regard
      to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article
      16 thereof,\\n\\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\\n\\nAfter
      transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\\n\\nHaving
      regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\\n\\nHaving
      regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\\n\\nActing in accordance
      with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\\n\\nWhereas:\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThe
      protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data
      is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
      the European Union (the \u2018Charter\u2019) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty
      on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the
      right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nThe
      principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to
      the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or
      residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their
      right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute
      to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an
      economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the
      convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being
      of natural persons.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights
      and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure
      the free flow of personal data between Member States.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection
      of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation
      to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights,
      in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects
      all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in
      the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private
      and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom
      of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information,
      freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair
      trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nThe economic
      and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market
      has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The
      exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural
      persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National
      authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate
      and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry
      out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nRapid
      technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for
      the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of
      personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies
      and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale
      in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal
      information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both
      the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of
      personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international
      organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data.\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nThose
      developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in
      the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the
      trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market.
      Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical
      certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should
      be enhanced.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nWhere this Regulation provides for specifications
      or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far
      as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible
      to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into
      their national law.\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nThe objectives and principles of Directive
      95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation
      of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public
      perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons,
      in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection
      of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the
      protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data
      in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the
      Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit
      of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede
      authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such
      a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences
      in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons
      and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the
      level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard
      to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent
      and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal
      data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal
      data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried
      out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
      the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national
      provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation.
      In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing
      Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas
      that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of
      manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing
      of special categories of personal data (\u2018sensitive data\u2019). To that
      extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the
      circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more
      precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nEffective
      protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening
      and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations
      of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well
      as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for
      the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in
      the Member States.\\n\\n(12)\\n\\nArticle 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament
      and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural
      persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating
      to the free movement of personal data.\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nIn order to ensure a consistent
      level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent
      divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal
      market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency
      for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally
      enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and
      processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data,
      and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation
      between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning
      of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within
      the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection
      of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account
      of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this
      Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees
      with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies,
      and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take
      account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in
      the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized
      enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation
      2003/361/EC (5).\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nThe protection afforded by this Regulation should
      apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence,
      in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not
      cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular
      undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of
      the legal person and the contact details of the legal person.\\n\\n(15)\\n\\nIn
      order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of
      natural persons should be technologically neutral and should not depend on the
      techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing
      of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the
      personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system.
      Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured
      according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.\\n\\n(16)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and
      freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall
      outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security.
      This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member
      States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security
      policy of the Union.\\n\\n(17)\\n\\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European
      Parliament and of the Council (6) applies to the processing of personal data
      by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No
      45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal
      data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this Regulation
      and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and
      coherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of
      Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should follow after the adoption of this Regulation,
      in order to allow application at the same time as this Regulation.\\n\\n(18)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person
      in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection
      to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or household activities could
      include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and
      online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this
      Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for
      processing personal data for such personal or household activities.\\n\\n(19)\\n\\nThe
      protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
      by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation,
      detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security
      and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal
      act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for
      those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under
      this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more
      specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (7). Member States may entrust competent authorities within
      the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily
      carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or
      prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including
      the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that
      the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is
      within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation.\\n\\nWith
      regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for
      purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able
      to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of
      the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific
      requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities
      for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational
      and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing
      of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation,
      this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific
      conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction
      constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
      safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention,
      investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution
      of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention
      of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework
      of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories.\\n\\n(20)\\n\\nWhile
      this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial
      authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations
      and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by
      courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory authorities
      should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their
      judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in
      the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision-making. It should
      be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific
      bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular
      ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among
      members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle
      complaints in relation to such data processing operations.\\n\\n(21)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of
      the European Parliament and of the Council (8), in particular of the liability
      rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive.
      That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal
      market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between
      Member States.\\n\\n(22)\\n\\nAny processing of personal data in the context
      of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the
      Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of
      whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies
      the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The
      legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with
      a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect.\\n\\n(23)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which
      they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of
      data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established
      in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities
      are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective
      of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller
      or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union,
      it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor
      envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in
      the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or
      an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact
      details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where
      the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention,
      factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or
      more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that
      other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union,
      may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services
      to data subjects in the Union.\\n\\n(24)\\n\\nThe processing of personal data
      of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established
      in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to
      the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour
      takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity
      can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained
      whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent
      use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural
      person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for
      analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\\n\\n(25)\\n\\nWhere
      Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation
      should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a
      Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post.\\n\\n(26)\\n\\nThe principles
      of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified
      or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation,
      which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information
      should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To
      determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken
      of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either
      by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly
      or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to
      identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors,
      such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking
      into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and
      technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore
      not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate
      to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered
      anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.
      This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous
      information, including for statistical or research purposes.\\n\\n(27)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States
      may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased
      persons.\\n\\n(28)\\n\\nThe application of pseudonymisation to personal data
      can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and
      processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction
      of \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 in this Regulation is not intended to preclude
      any other measures of data protection.\\n\\n(29)\\n\\nIn order to create incentives
      to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymisation
      should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller
      when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary
      to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented,
      and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific
      data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data
      should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller.\\n\\n(30)\\n\\nNatural
      persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices,
      applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie
      identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.
      This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers
      and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles
      of the natural persons and identify them.\\n\\n(31)\\n\\nPublic authorities
      to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for
      the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities,
      financial investigation units, independent administrative authorities, or financial
      market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities
      markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which
      are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in
      accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent
      by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional
      and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection
      of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities
      should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes
      of the processing.\\n\\n(32)\\n\\nConsent should be given by a clear affirmative
      act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication
      of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating
      to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means,
      or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet
      website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another
      statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's
      acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence,
      pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent
      should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes.
      When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of
      them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic
      means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to
      the use of the service for which it is provided.\\n\\n(33)\\n\\nIt is often
      not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific
      research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should
      be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when
      in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects
      should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research
      or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose.\\n\\n(34)\\n\\nGenetic
      data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired
      genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of
      a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal,
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the
      analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained.\\n\\n(35)\\n\\nPersonal
      data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status
      of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or
      future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information
      about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or
      the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU
      of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) to that natural person; a
      number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify
      the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing
      or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including from genetic data
      and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability,
      disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical
      state of the data subject independent of its source, for example from a physician
      or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic
      test.\\n\\n(36)\\n\\nThe main establishment of a controller in the Union should
      be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions
      on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another
      establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment
      should be considered to be the main establishment. The main establishment of
      a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria
      and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining
      the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable
      arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of
      personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical
      means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities
      do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not
      determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the
      processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or,
      if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing
      activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and
      the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory
      authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment,
      but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a
      supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate
      in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the
      supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor
      has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities
      concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing
      is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling
      undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of
      undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined
      by another undertaking.\\n\\n(37)\\n\\nA group of undertakings should cover
      a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling
      undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over
      the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation
      or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules
      implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in
      undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings,
      as a group of undertakings.\\n\\n(38)\\n\\nChildren merit specific protection
      with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks,
      consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing
      of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the
      use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality
      or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children
      when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of
      parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive
      or counselling services offered directly to a child.\\n\\n(39)\\n\\nAny processing
      of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural
      persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or
      otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.
      The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication
      relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy
      to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns,
      in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller
      and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and
      transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their
      right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them
      which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules,
      safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how
      to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the
      specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and
      legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data.
      The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
      for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular,
      ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to
      a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the
      processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure
      that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should
      be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every
      reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate
      are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that
      ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including
      for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment
      used for the processing.\\n\\n(40)\\n\\nIn order for processing to be lawful,
      personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject
      concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation
      or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including
      the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data
      subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject
      prior to entering into a contract.\\n\\n(41)\\n\\nWhere this Regulation refers
      to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require
      a legislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements
      pursuant to the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However,
      such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its
      application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with
      the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u2018Court
      of Justice\u2019) and the European Court of Human Rights.\\n\\n(42)\\n\\nWhere
      processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be
      able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing
      operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on another
      matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact
      that and the extent to which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive
      93/13/EEC (10) a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should
      be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain
      language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed,
      the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller
      and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.
      Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine
      or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\\n\\n(43)\\n\\nIn
      order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid
      legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there
      is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular
      where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that
      consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation.
      Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent
      to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being
      appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including
      the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent
      not being necessary for such performance.\\n\\n(44)\\n\\nProcessing should be
      lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to
      enter into a contract.\\n\\n(45)\\n\\nWhere processing is carried out in accordance
      with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis
      in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law
      for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations
      based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also
      be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore,
      that law could specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the
      lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining
      the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing,
      the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be
      disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to
      ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State
      law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the
      public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public
      authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where
      it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as
      public health and social protection and the management of health care services,
      by private law, such as a professional association.\\n\\n(46)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary
      to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or
      that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital
      interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where
      the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types
      of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital
      interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for
      humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or
      in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural
      and man-made disasters.\\n\\n(47)\\n\\nThe legitimate interests of a controller,
      including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed,
      or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that
      the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are
      not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data
      subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest
      could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship
      between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the
      data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the
      existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether
      a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection
      of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests
      and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the
      interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances
      where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that
      it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities
      to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing
      by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal
      data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes
      a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal
      data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate
      interest.\\n\\n(48)\\n\\nControllers that are part of a group of undertakings
      or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest
      in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal
      administrative purposes, including the processing of clients' or employees'
      personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal data, within
      a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain
      unaffected.\\n\\n(49)\\n\\nThe processing of personal data to the extent strictly
      necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information
      security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist,
      at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions
      that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality
      of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services
      offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities,
      by computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response
      teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and services
      and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate
      interest of the data controller concerned. This could, for example, include
      preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious
      code distribution and stopping \u2018denial of service\u2019 attacks and damage
      to computer and electronic communication systems.\\n\\n(50)\\n\\nThe processing
      of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were
      initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible
      with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such
      a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the
      personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance
      of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
      authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine
      and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be
      regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations.
      The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of
      personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order
      to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the
      purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller,
      after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing,
      should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the
      purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal
      data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data
      subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further
      use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further
      processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in
      both the original and intended further processing operations.\\n\\nWhere the
      data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member
      State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic
      society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public
      interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data
      irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application
      of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular the information
      of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including
      the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or
      threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal
      data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act
      or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as
      being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmission
      in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal
      data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal,
      professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.\\n\\n(51)\\n\\nPersonal
      data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental
      rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing
      could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those
      personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,
      whereby the use of the term \u2018racial origin\u2019 in this Regulation does
      not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine
      the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should
      not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal
      data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed
      through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication
      of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing
      is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account
      that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in
      order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance
      with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the
      public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
      In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles
      and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the
      conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for
      processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided,
      inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect
      of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course
      of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose
      of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n(52)\\n\\nDerogating
      from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should
      also be allowed when provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to
      suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights,
      where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal
      data in the field of employment law, social protection law including pensions
      and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control
      of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a derogation
      may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management
      of health-care services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness
      of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the
      health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should
      also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment,
      exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative
      or out-of-court procedure.\\n\\n(53)\\n\\nSpecial categories of personal data
      which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes
      only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons
      and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health
      or social care services and systems, including processing by the management
      and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality
      control, management information and the general national and local supervision
      of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social
      care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes,
      or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has
      to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in
      the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation
      should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories
      of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular
      where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related
      purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union
      or Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as
      to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons.
      Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions,
      including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric
      data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow
      of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border
      processing of such data.\\n\\n(54)\\n\\nThe processing of special categories
      of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas
      of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should
      be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons. In that context, \u2018public health\u2019 should
      be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (11), namely all elements related to health, namely health
      status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect
      on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care,
      the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care
      expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data
      concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal
      data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or
      insurance and banking companies.\\n\\n(55)\\n\\nMoreover, the processing of
      personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims,
      laid down by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially
      recognised religious associations, is carried out on grounds of public interest.\\n\\n(56)\\n\\nWhere
      in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system
      in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's
      political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons
      of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.\\n\\n(57)\\n\\nIf
      the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to
      identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire
      additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose
      of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller
      should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject
      in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. Identification should
      include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication
      mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to
      the on-line service offered by the data controller.\\n\\n(58)\\n\\nThe principle
      of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to
      the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that
      clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation
      be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example,
      when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance
      in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity
      of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether,
      by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being
      collected, such as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit
      specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is
      addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the
      child can easily understand.\\n\\n(59)\\n\\nModalities should be provided for
      facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation,
      including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge,
      in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the
      exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for
      requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed
      by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests
      from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month
      and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any
      such requests.\\n\\n(60)\\n\\nThe principles of fair and transparent processing
      require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing
      operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with
      any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing
      taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal
      data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the
      existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal
      data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed
      whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences,
      where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided
      in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible,
      intelligible and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the intended
      processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be machine-readable.\\n\\n(61)\\n\\nThe
      information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data
      subject should be given to him or her at the time of collection from the data
      subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source, within
      a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal
      data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should
      be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where
      the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than
      that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject
      prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and
      other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be
      provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general
      information should be provided.\\n\\n(62)\\n\\nHowever, it is not necessary
      to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already
      possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal
      data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to
      the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate
      effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried
      out for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of data
      subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should
      be taken into consideration.\\n\\n(63)\\n\\nA data subject should have the right
      of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her,
      and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be
      aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. This includes the right
      for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example
      the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses,
      examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or
      interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to
      know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for
      which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the
      personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic
      involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based
      on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller
      should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide
      the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right
      should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade
      secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting
      the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal
      to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes
      a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller
      should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data
      subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request
      relates.\\n\\n(64)\\n\\nThe controller should use all reasonable measures to
      verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in
      the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not
      retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential
      requests.\\n\\n(65)\\n\\nA data subject should have the right to have personal
      data concerning him or her rectified and a \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019
      where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member
      State law to which the controller is subject. In particular, a data subject
      should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer
      processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
      purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject
      has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data
      concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does
      not otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular
      where the data subject has given his or her consent as a child and is not fully
      aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such
      personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to
      exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child.
      However, the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it
      is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information,
      for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried
      out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
      the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health,
      for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
      purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence
      of legal claims.\\n\\n(66)\\n\\nTo strengthen the right to be forgotten in the
      online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way
      that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to
      inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any
      links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In doing so, that
      controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology
      and the means available to the controller, including technical measures, to
      inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subject's
      request.\\n\\n(67)\\n\\nMethods by which to restrict the processing of personal
      data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the selected data to another
      processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or
      temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems,
      the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means
      in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing
      operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data
      is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system.\\n\\n(68)\\n\\nTo further
      strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal
      data is carried out by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed
      to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided
      to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable
      format, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be
      encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. That
      right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the
      basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance
      of a contract. It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground
      other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be
      exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their
      public duties. It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal
      data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data
      subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should
      not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing
      systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal
      data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal
      data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects
      in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice
      the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the
      limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular,
      not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have
      been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent
      that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance
      of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the
      right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to
      another.\\n\\n(69)\\n\\nWhere personal data might lawfully be processed because
      processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
      interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller,
      or on grounds of the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party,
      a data subject should, nevertheless, be entitled to object to the processing
      of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should
      be for the controller to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest
      overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\\n\\n(70)\\n\\nWhere
      personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject
      should have the right to object to such processing, including profiling to the
      extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether with regard to initial
      or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That right should be
      explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly
      and separately from any other information.\\n\\n(71)\\n\\nThe data subject should
      have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure,
      evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on
      automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her
      or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of
      an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention.
      Such processing includes \u2018profiling\u2019 that consists of any form of
      automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating
      to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning
      the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
      preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where
      it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects
      him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling,
      should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to
      which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring
      and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards
      and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to
      ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller,
      or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data
      subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit
      consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards,
      which should include specific information to the data subject and the right
      to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain
      an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge
      the decision. Such measure should not concern a child.\\n\\nIn order to ensure
      fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into
      account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are
      processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical
      procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures
      appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies
      in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal
      data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the
      interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory
      effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political
      opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status
      or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect. Automated
      decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should
      be allowed only under specific conditions.\\n\\n(72)\\n\\nProfiling is subject
      to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such
      as the legal grounds for processing or data protection principles. The European
      Data Protection Board established by this Regulation (the \u2018Board\u2019)
      should be able to issue guidance in that context.\\n\\n(73)\\n\\nRestrictions
      concerning specific principles and the rights of information, access to and
      rectification or erasure of personal data, the right to data portability, the
      right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the communication
      of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations
      of the controllers may be imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessary
      and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard public security, including
      the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade disasters,
      the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution
      of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention
      of threats to public security, or of breaches of ethics for regulated professions,
      other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member
      State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union
      or of a Member State, the keeping of public registers kept for reasons of general
      public interest, further processing of archived personal data to provide specific
      information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state
      regimes or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of
      others, including social protection, public health and humanitarian purposes.
      Those restrictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in
      the Charter and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
      and Fundamental Freedoms.\\n\\n(74)\\n\\nThe responsibility and liability of
      the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller
      or on the controller's behalf should be established. In particular, the controller
      should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able
      to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation,
      including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into
      account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk
      to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(75)\\n\\nThe risk to the
      rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity,
      may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material
      or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to
      discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation,
      loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy,
      unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic
      or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights
      and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data;
      where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin, political
      opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the
      processing of genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life
      or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures; where personal
      aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting aspects concerning
      performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests,
      reliability or behaviour, location or movements, in order to create or use personal
      profiles; where personal data of vulnerable natural persons, in particular of
      children, are processed; or where processing involves a large amount of personal
      data and affects a large number of data subjects.\\n\\n(76)\\n\\nThe likelihood
      and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should
      be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
      processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment,
      by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk
      or a high risk.\\n\\n(77)\\n\\nGuidance on the implementation of appropriate
      measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor,
      especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing,
      their assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the
      identification of best practices to mitigate the risk, could be provided in
      particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications, guidelines
      provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer.
      The Board may also issue guidelines on processing operations that are considered
      to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons and indicate what measures may be sufficient in such cases to address
      such risk.\\n\\n(78)\\n\\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons with regard to the processing of personal data require that appropriate
      technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements
      of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with
      this Regulation, the controller should adopt internal policies and implement
      measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design
      and data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of
      minimising the processing of personal data, pseudonymising personal data as
      soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and processing of
      personal data, enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing, enabling
      the controller to create and improve security features. When developing, designing,
      selecting and using applications, services and products that are based on the
      processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers
      of the products, services and applications should be encouraged to take into
      account the right to data protection when developing and designing such products,
      services and applications and, with due regard to the state of the art, to make
      sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection
      obligations. The principles of data protection by design and by default should
      also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders.\\n\\n(79)\\n\\nThe
      protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility
      and liability of controllers and processors, also in relation to the monitoring
      by and measures of supervisory authorities, requires a clear allocation of the
      responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines
      the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where
      a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller.\\n\\n(80)\\n\\nWhere
      a controller or a processor not established in the Union is processing personal
      data of data subjects who are in the Union whose processing activities are related
      to the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the
      data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union, or to the monitoring
      of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union, the
      controller or the processor should designate a representative, unless the processing
      is occasional, does not include processing, on a large scale, of special categories
      of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions
      and offences, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes
      of the processing or if the controller is a public authority or body. The representative
      should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed
      by any supervisory authority. The representative should be explicitly designated
      by a written mandate of the controller or of the processor to act on its behalf
      with regard to its obligations under this Regulation. The designation of such
      a representative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller
      or of the processor under this Regulation. Such a representative should perform
      its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller or processor,
      including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard
      to any action taken to ensure compliance with this Regulation. The designated
      representative should be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of
      non-compliance by the controller or processor.\\n\\n(81)\\n\\nTo ensure compliance
      with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be
      carried out by the processor on behalf of the controller, when entrusting a
      processor with processing activities, the controller should use only processors
      providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms of expert knowledge,
      reliability and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures
      which will meet the requirements of this Regulation, including for the security
      of processing. The adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct
      or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate
      compliance with the obligations of the controller. The carrying-out of processing
      by a processor should be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union
      or Member State law, binding the processor to the controller, setting out the
      subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the
      processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects, taking
      into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the processor in the
      context of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms
      of the data subject. The controller and processor may choose to use an individual
      contract or standard contractual clauses which are adopted either directly by
      the Commission or by a supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency
      mechanism and then adopted by the Commission. After the completion of the processing
      on behalf of the controller, the processor should, at the choice of the controller,
      return or delete the personal data, unless there is a requirement to store the
      personal data under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject.\\n\\n(82)\\n\\nIn
      order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor
      should maintain records of processing activities under its responsibility. Each
      controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory
      authority and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might
      serve for monitoring those processing operations.\\n\\n(83)\\n\\nIn order to
      maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation,
      the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing
      and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. Those measures
      should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking
      into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation
      to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing
      data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented
      by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
      alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted,
      stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical, material
      or non-material damage.\\n\\n(84)\\n\\nIn order to enhance compliance with this
      Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible
      for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment to evaluate, in
      particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that risk. The
      outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the
      appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing
      of personal data complies with this Regulation. Where a data-protection impact
      assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the
      controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology
      and costs of implementation, a consultation of the supervisory authority should
      take place prior to the processing.\\n\\n(85)\\n\\nA personal data breach may,
      if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material
      or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their
      personal data or limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft
      or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage
      to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional
      secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural
      person concerned. Therefore, as soon as the controller becomes aware that a
      personal data breach has occurred, the controller should notify the personal
      data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible,
      not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the controller
      is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that
      the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons. Where such notification cannot be achieved within 72 hours,
      the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification and information
      may be provided in phases without undue further delay.\\n\\n(86)\\n\\nThe controller
      should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach, without undue
      delay, where that personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to allow him or her to
      take the necessary precautions. The communication should describe the nature
      of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person
      concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects. Such communications to data
      subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation
      with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other
      relevant authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need
      to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication
      with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against
      continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication.\\n\\n(87)\\n\\nIt
      should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational
      measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data
      breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and
      the data subject. The fact that the notification was made without undue delay
      should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity
      of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the
      data subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory
      authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation.\\n\\n(88)\\n\\nIn
      setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the
      notification of personal data breaches, due consideration should be given to
      the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not personal data had
      been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting
      the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules
      and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law-enforcement
      authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation
      of the circumstances of a personal data breach.\\n\\n(89)\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC
      provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data
      to the supervisory authorities. While that obligation produces administrative
      and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection
      of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should
      therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms
      which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely
      to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue
      of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations
      may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or are of
      a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out
      before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the
      time that has elapsed since the initial processing.\\n\\n(90)\\n\\nIn such cases,
      a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller
      prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity
      of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes
      of the processing and the sources of the risk. That impact assessment should
      include, in particular, the measures, safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for
      mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating
      compliance with this Regulation.\\n\\n(91)\\n\\nThis should in particular apply
      to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount
      of personal data at regional, national or supranational level and which could
      affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high
      risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in accordance with
      the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a
      large scale as well as to other processing operations which result in a high
      risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular where those
      operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights.
      A data protection impact assessment should also be made where personal data
      are processed for taking decisions regarding specific natural persons following
      any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural
      persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special
      categories of personal data, biometric data, or data on criminal convictions
      and offences or related security measures. A data protection impact assessment
      is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale,
      especially when using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where
      the competent supervisory authority considers that the processing is likely
      to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular
      because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service
      or a contract, or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale.
      The processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale
      if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual
      physician, other health care professional or lawyer. In such cases, a data protection
      impact assessment should not be mandatory.\\n\\n(92)\\n\\nThere are circumstances
      under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection
      impact assessment to be broader than a single project, for example where public
      authorities or bodies intend to establish a common application or processing
      platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common application
      or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely
      used horizontal activity.\\n\\n(93)\\n\\nIn the context of the adoption of the
      Member State law on which the performance of the tasks of the public authority
      or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation
      or set of operations in question, Member States may deem it necessary to carry
      out such assessment prior to the processing activities.\\n\\n(94)\\n\\nWhere
      a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in
      the absence of safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the
      risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and
      the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable
      means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation, the supervisory
      authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activities. Such
      high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent
      and frequency of processing, which may result also in a realisation of damage
      or interference with the rights and freedoms of the natural person. The supervisory
      authority should respond to the request for consultation within a specified
      period. However, the absence of a reaction of the supervisory authority within
      that period should be without prejudice to any intervention of the supervisory
      authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation,
      including the power to prohibit processing operations. As part of that consultation
      process, the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with
      regard to the processing at issue may be submitted to the supervisory authority,
      in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the rights and
      freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(95)\\n\\nThe processor should assist the
      controller, where necessary and upon request, in ensuring compliance with the
      obligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments
      and from prior consultation of the supervisory authority.\\n\\n(96)\\n\\nA consultation
      of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation
      of a legislative or regulatory measure which provides for the processing of
      personal data, in order to ensure compliance of the intended processing with
      this Regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data
      subject.\\n\\n(97)\\n\\nWhere the processing is carried out by a public authority,
      except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial
      capacity, where, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller
      whose core activities consist of processing operations that require regular
      and systematic monitoring of the data subjects on a large scale, or where the
      core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on
      a large scale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences, a person with expert knowledge of data protection
      law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor internal
      compliance with this Regulation. In the private sector, the core activities
      of a controller relate to its primary activities and do not relate to the processing
      of personal data as ancillary activities. The necessary level of expert knowledge
      should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations
      carried out and the protection required for the personal data processed by the
      controller or the processor. Such data protection officers, whether or not they
      are an employee of the controller, should be in a position to perform their
      duties and tasks in an independent manner.\\n\\n(98)\\n\\nAssociations or other
      bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged
      to draw up codes of conduct, within the limits of this Regulation, so as to
      facilitate the effective application of this Regulation, taking account of the
      specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and
      the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. In particular, such
      codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors,
      taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights
      and freedoms of natural persons.\\n\\n(99)\\n\\nWhen drawing up a code of conduct,
      or when amending or extending such a code, associations and other bodies representing
      categories of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders,
      including data subjects where feasible, and have regard to submissions received
      and views expressed in response to such consultations.\\n\\n(100)\\n\\nIn order
      to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment
      of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged,
      allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant
      products and services.\\n\\n(101)\\n\\nFlows of personal data to and from countries
      outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion
      of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in such flows
      has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal
      data. However, when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers,
      processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations,
      the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation
      should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal
      data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors
      in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any event,
      transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried
      out in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only
      if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid
      down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal
      data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by
      the controller or processor.\\n\\n(102)\\n\\nThis Regulation is without prejudice
      to international agreements concluded between the Union and third countries
      regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for
      the data subjects. Member States may conclude international agreements which
      involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations,
      as far as such agreements do not affect this Regulation or any other provisions
      of Union law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental
      rights of the data subjects.\\n\\n(103)\\n\\nThe Commission may decide with
      effect for the entire Union that a third country, a territory or specified sector
      within a third country, or an international organisation, offers an adequate
      level of data protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout
      the Union as regards the third country or international organisation which is
      considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers of
      personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place
      without the need to obtain any further authorisation. The Commission may also
      decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to
      the third country or international organisation, to revoke such a decision.\\n\\n(104)\\n\\nIn
      line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular
      the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its assessment of
      the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third country,
      take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access
      to justice as well as international human rights norms and standards and its
      general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security,
      defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The
      adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector
      in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria, such
      as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards
      and legislation in force in the third country. The third country should offer
      guarantees ensuring an adequate level of protection essentially equivalent to
      that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are processed
      in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the third country should
      ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide
      for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data protection authorities,
      and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights
      and effective administrative and judicial redress.\\n\\n(105)\\n\\nApart from
      the international commitments the third country or international organisation
      has entered into, the Commission should take account of obligations arising
      from the third country's or international organisation's participation in multilateral
      or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal
      data, as well as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the
      third country's accession to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January
      1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing
      of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be taken into account. The
      Commission should consult the Board when assessing the level of protection in
      third countries or international organisations.\\n\\n(106)\\n\\nThe Commission
      should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a
      third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an
      international organisation, and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted
      on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its
      adequacy decisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism
      of their functioning. That periodic review should be conducted in consultation
      with the third country or international organisation in question and take into
      account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation.
      For the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the
      Commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the European
      Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources.
      The Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of
      the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the Committee within
      the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of
      the Council (12) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament
      and to the Council.\\n\\n(107)\\n\\nThe Commission may recognise that a third
      country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international
      organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently
      the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation
      should be prohibited, unless the requirements in this Regulation relating to
      transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules,
      and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision
      should be made for consultations between the Commission and such third countries
      or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely manner, inform
      the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into
      consultations with it in order to remedy the situation.\\n\\n(108)\\n\\nIn the
      absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor should take measures
      to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate
      safeguards for the data subject. Such appropriate safeguards may consist of
      making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted
      by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory
      authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority. Those
      safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the
      rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including
      the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies,
      including to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim
      compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular
      to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing,
      the principles of data protection by design and by default. Transfers may also
      be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies
      in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties
      or functions, including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative
      arrangements, such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable
      and effective rights for data subjects. Authorisation by the competent supervisory
      authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative
      arrangements that are not legally binding.\\n\\n(109)\\n\\nThe possibility for
      the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopted
      by the Commission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or
      processors neither from including the standard data-protection clauses in a
      wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another processor,
      nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do
      not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted
      by the Commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental
      rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors should be
      encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that
      supplement standard protection clauses.\\n\\n(110)\\n\\nA group of undertakings,
      or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, should be able
      to make use of approved binding corporate rules for its international transfers
      from the Union to organisations within the same group of undertakings, or group
      of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, provided that such corporate
      rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate
      safeguards for transfers or categories of transfers of personal data.\\n\\n(111)\\n\\nProvisions
      should be made for the possibility for transfers in certain circumstances where
      the data subject has given his or her explicit consent, where the transfer is
      occasional and necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim, regardless
      of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any out-of-court
      procedure, including procedures before regulatory bodies. Provision should also
      be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds of public
      interest laid down by Union or Member State law so require or where the transfer
      is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by
      the public or persons having a legitimate interest. In the latter case, such
      a transfer should not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories
      of the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for
      consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be
      made only at the request of those persons or, if they are to be the recipients,
      taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject.\\n\\n(112)\\n\\nThose
      derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary
      for important reasons of public interest, for example in cases of international
      data exchange between competition authorities, tax or customs administrations,
      between financial supervisory authorities, between services competent for social
      security matters, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing
      for contagious diseases or in order to reduce and/or eliminate doping in sport.
      A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary
      to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's or another
      person's vital interests, including physical integrity or life, if the data
      subject is incapable of giving consent. In the absence of an adequacy decision,
      Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly
      set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country
      or an international organisation. Member States should notify such provisions
      to the Commission. Any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation
      of personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of
      giving consent, with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva
      Conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law applicable in
      armed conflicts, could be considered to be necessary for an important reason
      of public interest or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject.\\n\\n(113)\\n\\nTransfers
      which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number
      of data subjects, could also be possible for the purposes of the compelling
      legitimate interests pursued by the controller, when those interests are not
      overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when
      the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer.
      The controller should give particular consideration to the nature of the personal
      data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations,
      as well as the situation in the country of origin, the third country and the
      country of final destination, and should provide suitable safeguards to protect
      fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing
      of their personal data. Such transfers should be possible only in residual cases
      where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, the legitimate expectations
      of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into consideration.
      The controller should inform the supervisory authority and the data subject
      about the transfer.\\n\\n(114)\\n\\nIn any case, where the Commission has taken
      no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third country, the
      controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects
      with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing of their data
      in the Union once those data have been transferred so that that they will continue
      to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards.\\n\\n(115)\\n\\nSome third
      countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly
      regulate the processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction
      of the Member States. This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions
      of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor
      to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international
      agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting
      third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application
      of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international
      law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured
      in the Union by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the
      conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This
      may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important
      ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the
      controller is subject.\\n\\n(116)\\n\\nWhen personal data moves across borders
      outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons
      to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from
      the unlawful use or disclosure of that information. At the same time, supervisory
      authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations
      relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together
      in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative
      or remedial powers, inconsistent legal regimes, and practical obstacles like
      resource constraints. Therefore, there is a need to promote closer cooperation
      among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information
      and carry out investigations with their international counterparts. For the
      purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate and
      provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for
      the protection of personal data, the Commission and the supervisory authorities
      should exchange information and cooperate in activities related to the exercise
      of their powers with competent authorities in third countries, based on reciprocity
      and in accordance with this Regulation.\\n\\n(117)\\n\\nThe establishment of
      supervisory authorities in Member States, empowered to perform their tasks and
      exercise their powers with complete independence, is an essential component
      of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their
      personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one supervisory
      authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative
      structure.\\n\\n(118)\\n\\nThe independence of supervisory authorities should
      not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject to control or monitoring
      mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review.\\n\\n(119)\\n\\nWhere
      a Member State establishes several supervisory authorities, it should establish
      by law mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of those supervisory
      authorities in the consistency mechanism. That Member State should in particular
      designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point
      for the effective participation of those authorities in the mechanism, to ensure
      swift and smooth cooperation with other supervisory authorities, the Board and
      the Commission.\\n\\n(120)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority should be provided
      with the financial and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary
      for the effective performance of their tasks, including those related to mutual
      assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the
      Union. Each supervisory authority should have a separate, public annual budget,
      which may be part of the overall state or national budget.\\n\\n(121)\\n\\nThe
      general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority should
      be laid down by law in each Member State and should in particular provide that
      those members are to be appointed, by means of a transparent procedure, either
      by the parliament, government or the head of State of the Member State on the
      basis of a proposal from the government, a member of the government, the parliament
      or a chamber of the parliament, or by an independent body entrusted under Member
      State law. In order to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority,
      the member or members should act with integrity, refrain from any action that
      is incompatible with their duties and should not, during their term of office,
      engage in any incompatible occupation, whether gainful or not. The supervisory
      authority should have its own staff, chosen by the supervisory authority or
      an independent body established by Member State law, which should be subject
      to the exclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority.\\n\\n(122)\\n\\nEach
      supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own Member
      State to exercise the powers and to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance
      with this Regulation. This should cover in particular the processing in the
      context of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor
      on the territory of its own Member State, the processing of personal data carried
      out by public authorities or private bodies acting in the public interest, processing
      affecting data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller
      or processor not established in the Union when targeting data subjects residing
      on its territory. This should include handling complaints lodged by a data subject,
      conducting investigations on the application of this Regulation and promoting
      public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the
      processing of personal data.\\n\\n(123)\\n\\nThe supervisory authorities should
      monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and contribute
      to its consistent application throughout the Union, in order to protect natural
      persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate
      the free flow of personal data within the internal market. For that purpose,
      the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the Commission,
      without the need for any agreement between Member States on the provision of
      mutual assistance or on such cooperation.\\n\\n(124)\\n\\nWhere the processing
      of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment
      of a controller or a processor in the Union and the controller or processor
      is established in more than one Member State, or where processing taking place
      in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or
      processor in the Union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect
      data subjects in more than one Member State, the supervisory authority for the
      main establishment of the controller or processor or for the single establishment
      of the controller or processor should act as lead authority. It should cooperate
      with the other authorities concerned, because the controller or processor has
      an establishment on the territory of their Member State, because data subjects
      residing on their territory are substantially affected, or because a complaint
      has been lodged with them. Also where a data subject not residing in that Member
      State has lodged a complaint, the supervisory authority with which such complaint
      has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority concerned. Within its
      tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this Regulation,
      the Board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to
      be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the processing in question
      substantially affects data subjects in more than one Member State and on what
      constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection.\\n\\n(125)\\n\\nThe lead authority
      should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the
      powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. In its capacity as
      lead authority, the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate
      the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process. Where
      the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part,
      that decision should be adopted by the supervisory authority with which the
      complaint has been lodged.\\n\\n(126)\\n\\nThe decision should be agreed jointly
      by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned
      and should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller
      or processor and be binding on the controller and processor. The controller
      or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this
      Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory
      authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards
      the processing activities in the Union.\\n\\n(127)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority
      not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local
      cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member
      State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing
      carried out in a single Member State and involves only data subjects in that
      single Member State, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing
      of employees' personal data in the specific employment context of a Member State.
      In such cases, the supervisory authority should inform the lead supervisory
      authority without delay about the matter. After being informed, the lead supervisory
      authority should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision
      on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory
      authorities concerned (\u2018one-stop-shop mechanism\u2019), or whether the
      supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level.
      When deciding whether it will handle the case, the lead supervisory authority
      should take into account whether there is an establishment of the controller
      or processor in the Member State of the supervisory authority which informed
      it in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-\xE0-vis the controller
      or processor. Where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case,
      the supervisory authority which informed it should have the possibility to submit
      a draft for a decision, of which the lead supervisory authority should take
      utmost account when preparing its draft decision in that one-stop-shop mechanism.\\n\\n(128)\\n\\nThe
      rules on the lead supervisory authority and the one-stop-shop mechanism should
      not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities or private
      bodies in the public interest. In such cases the only supervisory authority
      competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this Regulation
      should be the supervisory authority of the Member State where the public authority
      or private body is established.\\n\\n(129)\\n\\nIn order to ensure consistent
      monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory
      authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers,
      including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and authorisation
      and advisory powers, in particular in cases of complaints from natural persons,
      and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under Member
      State law, to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the
      judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings. Such powers should also
      include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation, including
      a ban, on processing. Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection
      of personal data under this Regulation. The powers of supervisory authorities
      should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set
      out in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable
      time. In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate
      in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the
      circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person to
      be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely
      is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons
      concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised
      in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such
      as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding
      measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous,
      indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure, the date of
      issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of the supervisory
      authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer
      to the right of an effective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements
      pursuant to Member State procedural law. The adoption of a legally binding decision
      implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the
      supervisory authority that adopted the decision.\\n\\n(130)\\n\\nWhere the supervisory
      authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory
      authority, the lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the
      supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged in accordance
      with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this Regulation.
      In such cases, the lead supervisory authority should, when taking measures intended
      to produce legal effects, including the imposition of administrative fines,
      take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority with which the
      complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any
      investigation on the territory of its own Member State in liaison with the competent
      supervisory authority.\\n\\n(131)\\n\\nWhere another supervisory authority should
      act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of the controller
      or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible
      infringement concerns only processing activities of the controller or processor
      in the Member State where the complaint has been lodged or the possible infringement
      detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to substantially
      affect data subjects in other Member States, the supervisory authority receiving
      a complaint or detecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail
      possible infringements of this Regulation should seek an amicable settlement
      with the controller and, if this proves unsuccessful, exercise its full range
      of powers. This should include: specific processing carried out in the territory
      of the Member State of the supervisory authority or with regard to data subjects
      on the territory of that Member State; processing that is carried out in the
      context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects
      in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority; or processing
      that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal obligations under
      Member State law.\\n\\n(132)\\n\\nAwareness-raising activities by supervisory
      authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures directed
      at controllers and processors, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
      as well as natural persons in particular in the educational context.\\n\\n(133)\\n\\nThe
      supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and
      provide mutual assistance, so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement
      of this Regulation in the internal market. A supervisory authority requesting
      mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response
      to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request
      by the other supervisory authority.\\n\\n(134)\\n\\nEach supervisory authority
      should, where appropriate, participate in joint operations with other supervisory
      authorities. The requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond
      to the request within a specified time period.\\n\\n(135)\\n\\nIn order to ensure
      the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency
      mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established.
      That mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends
      to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations
      which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several
      Member States. It should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned
      or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency
      mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the
      Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties.\\n\\n(136)\\n\\nIn
      applying the consistency mechanism, the Board should, within a determined period
      of time, issue an opinion, if a majority of its members so decides or if so
      requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission. The Board
      should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are
      disputes between supervisory authorities. For that purpose, it should issue,
      in principle by a two-thirds majority of its members, legally binding decisions
      in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory
      authorities, in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory
      authority and supervisory authorities concerned on the merits of the case, in
      particular whether there is an infringement of this Regulation.\\n\\n(137)\\n\\nThere
      may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of
      data subjects, in particular when the danger exists that the enforcement of
      a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded. A supervisory authority
      should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its
      territory with a specified period of validity which should not exceed three
      months.\\n\\n(138)\\n\\nThe application of such mechanism should be a condition
      for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce legal effects by a supervisory
      authority in those cases where its application is mandatory. In other cases
      of cross-border relevance, the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory
      authority and supervisory authorities concerned should be applied and mutual
      assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the supervisory
      authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering
      the consistency mechanism.\\n\\n(139)\\n\\nIn order to promote the consistent
      application of this Regulation, the Board should be set up as an independent
      body of the Union. To fulfil its objectives, the Board should have legal personality.
      The Board should be represented by its Chair. It should replace the Working
      Party on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal
      Data established by Directive 95/46/EC. It should consist of the head of a supervisory
      authority of each Member State and the European Data Protection Supervisor or
      their respective representatives. The Commission should participate in the Board's
      activities without voting rights and the European Data Protection Supervisor
      should have specific voting rights. The Board should contribute to the consistent
      application of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by advising the
      Commission, in particular on the level of protection in third countries or international
      organisations, and promoting cooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout
      the Union. The Board should act independently when performing its tasks.\\n\\n(140)\\n\\nThe
      Board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the European Data Protection
      Supervisor. The staff of the European Data Protection Supervisor involved in
      carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this Regulation should perform
      its tasks exclusively under the instructions of, and report to, the Chair of
      the Board.\\n\\n(141)\\n\\nEvery data subject should have the right to lodge
      a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in the Member
      State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial
      remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter if the data subject considers
      that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed or where the supervisory
      authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses
      a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights
      of the data subject. The investigation following a complaint should be carried
      out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific
      case. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress
      and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires
      further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate
      information should be given to the data subject. In order to facilitate the
      submission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such
      as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically,
      without excluding other means of communication.\\n\\n(142)\\n\\nWhere a data
      subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed,
      he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation
      or association which is constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State,
      has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the
      field of the protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her
      behalf with a supervisory authority, exercise the right to a judicial remedy
      on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise
      the right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State
      may provide for such a body, organisation or association to have the right to
      lodge a complaint in that Member State, independently of a data subject's mandate,
      and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider
      that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing
      of personal data which infringes this Regulation. That body, organisation or
      association may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subject's behalf
      independently of the data subject's mandate.\\n\\n(143)\\n\\nAny natural or
      legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of
      the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article
      263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities concerned
      which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being
      notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the
      Board are of direct and individual concern to a controller, processor or complainant,
      the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within
      two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with
      Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each
      natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the
      competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which
      produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular
      the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory
      authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to
      an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory
      authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice
      provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority
      should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory
      authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member
      State's procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which
      should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant
      to the dispute before them.\\n\\nWhere a complaint has been rejected or dismissed
      by a supervisory authority, the complainant may bring proceedings before the
      courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating
      to the application of this Regulation, national courts which consider a decision
      on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment, may, or in the case
      provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the Court of Justice to give
      a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including this Regulation.
      Furthermore, where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision
      of the Board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision
      of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare
      the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the
      Court of Justice in accordance with Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court
      of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a national court
      may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the
      request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action
      for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was directly and individually
      concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down
      in Article 263 TFEU.\\n\\n(144)\\n\\nWhere a court seized of proceedings against
      a decision by a supervisory authority has reason to believe that proceedings
      concerning the same processing, such as the same subject matter as regards processing
      by the same controller or processor, or the same cause of action, are brought
      before a competent court in another Member State, it should contact that court
      in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings. If related proceedings
      are pending before a court in another Member State, any court other than the
      court first seized may stay its proceedings or may, on request of one of the
      parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seized if that court
      has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consolidation
      of such related proceedings. Proceedings are deemed to be related where they
      are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together
      in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate
      proceedings.\\n\\n(145)\\n\\nFor proceedings against a controller or processor,
      the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before the courts of
      the Member States where the controller or processor has an establishment or
      where the data subject resides, unless the controller is a public authority
      of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.\\n\\n(146)\\n\\nThe
      controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer
      as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or
      processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any
      way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted
      in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully
      reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any
      claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member
      State law. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing
      that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this
      Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data subjects
      should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered.
      Where controllers or processors are involved in the same processing, each controller
      or processor should be held liable for the entire damage. However, where they
      are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State
      law, compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each
      controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing, provided that
      full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the damage
      is ensured. Any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may
      subsequently institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors
      involved in the same processing.\\n\\n(147)\\n\\nWhere specific rules on jurisdiction
      are contained in this Regulation, in particular as regards proceedings seeking
      a judicial remedy including compensation, against a controller or processor,
      general jurisdiction rules such as those of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of
      the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should not prejudice the application
      of such specific rules.\\n\\n(148)\\n\\nIn order to strengthen the enforcement
      of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines should
      be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instead
      of appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this
      Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed
      would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand
      may be issued instead of a fine. Due regard should however be given to the nature,
      gravity and duration of the infringement, the intentional character of the infringement,
      actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any
      relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became
      known to the supervisory authority, compliance with measures ordered against
      the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating
      or mitigating factor. The imposition of penalties including administrative fines
      should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the
      general principles of Union law and the Charter, including effective judicial
      protection and due process.\\n\\n(149)\\n\\nMember States should be able to
      lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this Regulation,
      including for infringements of national rules adopted pursuant to and within
      the limits of this Regulation. Those criminal penalties may also allow for the
      deprivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this Regulation.
      However, the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national
      rules and of administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle
      of ne bis in idem, as interpreted by the Court of Justice.\\n\\n(150)\\n\\nIn
      order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements
      of this Regulation, each supervisory authority should have the power to impose
      administrative fines. This Regulation should indicate infringements and the
      upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which
      should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual
      case, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation,
      with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement
      and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the
      obligations under this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences
      of the infringement. Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking,
      an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with
      Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are
      imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the supervisory authority should
      take account of the general level of income in the Member State as well as the
      economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the
      fine. The consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application
      of administrative fines. It should be for the Member States to determine whether
      and to which extent public authorities should be subject to administrative fines.
      Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application
      of other powers of the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this
      Regulation.\\n\\n(151)\\n\\nThe legal systems of Denmark and Estonia do not
      allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The rules on administrative
      fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by
      competent national courts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed
      by the supervisory authority in the framework of a misdemeanour procedure, provided
      that such an application of the rules in those Member States has an equivalent
      effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. Therefore
      the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation by
      the supervisory authority initiating the fine. In any event, the fines imposed
      should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\\n\\n(152)\\n\\nWhere this
      Regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in
      other cases, for example in cases of serious infringements of this Regulation,
      Member States should implement a system which provides for effective, proportionate
      and dissuasive penalties. The nature of such penalties, criminal or administrative,
      should be determined by Member State law.\\n\\n(153)\\n\\nMember States law
      should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information,
      including journalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the
      right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The processing
      of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the purposes of academic,
      artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exemptions
      from certain provisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right
      to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and
      information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter. This should apply in
      particular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in
      news archives and press libraries. Therefore, Member States should adopt legislative
      measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose
      of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exemptions
      and derogations on general principles, the rights of the data subject, the controller
      and the processor, the transfer of personal data to third countries or international
      organisations, the independent supervisory authorities, cooperation and consistency,
      and specific data-processing situations. Where such exemptions or derogations
      differ from one Member State to another, the law of the Member State to which
      the controller is subject should apply. In order to take account of the importance
      of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary
      to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly.\\n\\n(154)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be
      taken into account when applying this Regulation. Public access to official
      documents may be considered to be in the public interest. Personal data in documents
      held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed
      by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member
      State law to which the public authority or public body is subject. Such laws
      should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse of public
      sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may
      therefore provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection
      of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The reference to public authorities
      and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered
      by Member State law on public access to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council (14) leaves intact and in no way affects
      the level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
      personal data under the provisions of Union and Member State law, and in particular
      does not alter the obligations and rights set out in this Regulation. In particular,
      that Directive should not apply to documents to which access is excluded or
      restricted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of protection of personal
      data, and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain
      personal data the re-use of which has been provided for by law as being incompatible
      with the law concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the
      processing of personal data.\\n\\n(155)\\n\\nMember State law or collective
      agreements, including \u2018works agreements\u2019, may provide for specific
      rules on the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context,
      in particular for the conditions under which personal data in the employment
      context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the purposes
      of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including
      discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management,
      planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace,
      health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment,
      on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment,
      and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship.\\n\\n(156)\\n\\nThe
      processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to
      appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant
      to this Regulation. Those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational
      measures are in place in order to ensure, in particular, the principle of data
      minimisation. The further processing of personal data for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility
      to fulfil those purposes by processing data which do not permit or no longer
      permit the identification of data subjects, provided that appropriate safeguards
      exist (such as, for instance, pseudonymisation of the data). Member States should
      provide for appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. Member States should be authorised to provide, under
      specific conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects,
      specifications and derogations with regard to the information requirements and
      rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgotten, to restriction of processing,
      to data portability, and to object when processing personal data for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes. The conditions and safeguards in question may entail
      specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate
      in the light of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical
      and organisational measures aimed at minimising the processing of personal data
      in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles. The processing
      of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant
      legislation such as on clinical trials.\\n\\n(157)\\n\\nBy coupling information
      from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard
      to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and
      depression. On the basis of registries, research results can be enhanced, as
      they draw on a larger population. Within social science, research on the basis
      of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term
      correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education
      with other life conditions. Research results obtained through registries provide
      solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation
      and implementation of knowledge-based policy, improve the quality of life for
      a number of people and improve the efficiency of social services. In order to
      facilitate scientific research, personal data can be processed for scientific
      research purposes, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out
      in Union or Member State law.\\n\\n(158)\\n\\nWhere personal data are processed
      for archiving purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing,
      bearing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. Public
      authorities or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest
      should be services which, pursuant to Union or Member State law, have a legal
      obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote,
      disseminate and provide access to records of enduring value for general public
      interest. Member States should also be authorised to provide for the further
      processing of personal data for archiving purposes, for example with a view
      to providing specific information related to the political behaviour under former
      totalitarian state regimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, in particular
      the Holocaust, or war crimes.\\n\\n(159)\\n\\nWhere personal data are processed
      for scientific research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that
      processing. For the purposes of this Regulation, the processing of personal
      data for scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner
      including for example technological development and demonstration, fundamental
      research, applied research and privately funded research. In addition, it should
      take into account the Union's objective under Article 179(1) TFEU of achieving
      a European Research Area. Scientific research purposes should also include studies
      conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. To meet the specificities
      of processing personal data for scientific research purposes, specific conditions
      should apply in particular as regards the publication or otherwise disclosure
      of personal data in the context of scientific research purposes. If the result
      of scientific research in particular in the health context gives reason for
      further measures in the interest of the data subject, the general rules of this
      Regulation should apply in view of those measures.\\n\\n(160)\\n\\nWhere personal
      data are processed for historical research purposes, this Regulation should
      also apply to that processing. This should also include historical research
      and research for genealogical purposes, bearing in mind that this Regulation
      should not apply to deceased persons.\\n\\n(161)\\n\\nFor the purpose of consenting
      to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials, the
      relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament
      and of the Council (15) should apply.\\n\\n(162)\\n\\nWhere personal data are
      processed for statistical purposes, this Regulation should apply to that processing.
      Union or Member State law should, within the limits of this Regulation, determine
      statistical content, control of access, specifications for the processing of
      personal data for statistical purposes and appropriate measures to safeguard
      the rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality.
      Statistical purposes mean any operation of collection and the processing of
      personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical
      results. Those statistical results may further be used for different purposes,
      including a scientific research purpose. The statistical purpose implies that
      the result of processing for statistical purposes is not personal data, but
      aggregate data, and that this result or the personal data are not used in support
      of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person.\\n\\n(163)\\n\\nThe
      confidential information which the Union and national statistical authorities
      collect for the production of official European and official national statistics
      should be protected. European statistics should be developed, produced and disseminated
      in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in Article 338(2) TFEU,
      while national statistics should also comply with Member State law. Regulation
      (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) provides
      further specifications on statistical confidentiality for European statistics.\\n\\n(164)\\n\\nAs
      regards the powers of the supervisory authorities to obtain from the controller
      or processor access to personal data and access to their premises, Member States
      may adopt by law, within the limits of this Regulation, specific rules in order
      to safeguard the professional or other equivalent secrecy obligations, in so
      far as necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with
      an obligation of professional secrecy. This is without prejudice to existing
      Member State obligations to adopt rules on professional secrecy where required
      by Union law.\\n\\n(165)\\n\\nThis Regulation respects and does not prejudice
      the status under existing constitutional law of churches and religious associations
      or communities in the Member States, as recognised in Article 17 TFEU.\\n\\n(166)\\n\\nIn
      order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, namely to protect the fundamental
      rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the
      protection of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal data
      within the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU
      should be delegated to the Commission. In particular, delegated acts should
      be adopted in respect of criteria and requirements for certification mechanisms,
      information to be presented by standardised icons and procedures for providing
      such icons. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate
      consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission,
      when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous,
      timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament
      and to the Council.\\n\\n(167)\\n\\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for
      the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred
      on the Commission when provided for by this Regulation. Those powers should
      be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. In that context,
      the Commission should consider specific measures for micro, small and medium-sized
      enterprises.\\n\\n(168)\\n\\nThe examination procedure should be used for the
      adoption of implementing acts on standard contractual clauses between controllers
      and processors and between processors; codes of conduct; technical standards
      and mechanisms for certification; the adequate level of protection afforded
      by a third country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country,
      or an international organisation; standard protection clauses; formats and procedures
      for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers, processors
      and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules; mutual assistance;
      and arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between
      supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board.\\n\\n(169)\\n\\nThe
      Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where available
      evidence reveals that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within
      that third country, or an international organisation does not ensure an adequate
      level of protection, and imperative grounds of urgency so require.\\n\\n(170)\\n\\nSince
      the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection
      of natural persons and the free flow of personal data throughout the Union,
      cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason
      of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the
      Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as
      set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with
      the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation
      does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\\n\\n(171)\\n\\nDirective
      95/46/EC should be repealed by this Regulation. Processing already under way
      on the date of application of this Regulation should be brought into conformity
      with this Regulation within the period of two years after which this Regulation
      enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pursuant to Directive
      95/46/EC, it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent
      again if the manner in which the consent has been given is in line with the
      conditions of this Regulation, so as to allow the controller to continue such
      processing after the date of application of this Regulation. Commission decisions
      adopted and authorisations by supervisory authorities based on Directive 95/46/EC
      remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed.\\n\\n(172)\\n\\nThe European
      Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of
      Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 7 March 2012 (17).\\n\\n(173)\\n\\nThis
      Regulation should apply to all matters concerning the protection of fundamental
      rights and freedoms vis-\xE0-vis the processing of personal data which are not
      subject to specific obligations with the same objective set out in Directive
      2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), including the
      obligations on the controller and the rights of natural persons. In order to
      clarify the relationship between this Regulation and Directive 2002/58/EC, that
      Directive should be amended accordingly. Once this Regulation is adopted, Directive
      2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with
      this Regulation,\\n\\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nGeneral
      provisions\\n\\nArticle 1\\n\\nSubject-matter and objectives\\n\\n1. This Regulation
      lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to
      the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal
      data.\\n\\n2. This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural
      persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.\\n\\n3.
      The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted
      nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons
      with regard to the processing of personal data.\\n\\nArticle 2\\n\\nMaterial
      scope\\n\\n1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly
      or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means
      of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form
      part of a filing system.\\n\\n2. This Regulation does not apply to the processing
      of personal data:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nin the course of an activity which falls outside
      the scope of Union law;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nby the Member States when carrying out
      activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the TEU;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nby
      a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nby
      competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection
      or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,
      including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\\n\\n3.
      For the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices
      and agencies, Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 applies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001
      and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data shall
      be adapted to the principles and rules of this Regulation in accordance with
      Article 98.\\n\\n4. This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application
      of Directive 2000/31/EC, in particular of the liability rules of intermediary
      service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive.\\n\\nArticle 3\\n\\nTerritorial
      scope\\n\\n1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in
      the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor
      in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union
      or not.\\n\\n2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of
      data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established
      in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data
      subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the
      Union.\\n\\n3. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data by
      a controller not established in the Union, but in a place where Member State
      law applies by virtue of public international law.\\n\\nArticle 4\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nFor

      public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular
      inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
      recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be
      in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes
      of the processing;\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\u2018third party\u2019 means a natural or

      establishment\u2019 means:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nas regards a controller with establishments
      in more than one Member State, the place of its central administration in the
      Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal
      data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union and the
      latter establishment has the power to have such decisions implemented, in which
      case the establishment having taken such decisions is to be considered to be
      the main establishment;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nas regards a processor with establishments
      in more than one Member State, the place of its central administration in the
      Union, or, if the processor has no central administration in the Union, the

      complies with this Regulation, which clearly demonstrates the significance of
      the risks posed by the draft decision as regards the fundamental rights and
      freedoms of data subjects and, where applicable, the free flow of personal data
      within the Union;\\n\\n(25)\\n\\n\u2018information society service\u2019 means

      basis of, an agreement between two or more countries.\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nPrinciples\\n\\nArticle
      5\\n\\nPrinciples relating to processing of personal data\\n\\n1. Personal data
      shall be:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nprocessed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner
      in relation to the data subject (\u2018lawfulness, fairness and transparency\u2019);\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ncollected
      for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in
      a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered
      to be incompatible with the initial purposes (\u2018purpose limitation\u2019);\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nadequate,
      relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
      they are processed (\u2018data minimisation\u2019);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\naccurate and,
      where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
      that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which
      they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (\u2018accuracy\u2019);\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nkept
      in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is
      necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal
      data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed
      solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject
      to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required
      by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data
      subject (\u2018storage limitation\u2019);\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessed in a manner
      that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
      against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction
      or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (\u2018integrity
      and confidentiality\u2019).\\n\\n2. The controller shall be responsible for,
      and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (\u2018accountability\u2019).\\n\\nArticle
      6\\n\\nLawfulness of processing\\n\\n1. Processing shall be lawful only if and
      to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data
      for one or more specific purposes;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for
      the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order
      to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
      is subject;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary in order to protect the vital
      interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller
      or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests
      or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection
      of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\\n\\nPoint
      (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public
      authorities in the performance of their tasks.\\n\\n2. Member States may maintain
      or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules
      of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c)
      and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for
      the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including
      for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.\\n\\n3.
      The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1
      shall be laid down by:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nUnion law; or\\n</document_text>\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\"max_tokens\":4096,\"stream\":false,\"temperature\":0.3,\"top_p\":0.3}"

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>

      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n

      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if

      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>

      State law to which the controller is subject.\\n\\nThe purpose of the processing
      shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred
      to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a
      task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
      vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to
      adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions
      governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data
      which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities
      to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose
      limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures,
      including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other
      specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the
      Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate
      to the legitimate aim pursued.\\n\\n4. Where the processing for a purpose other
      than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the
      data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a
      necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the
      objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain
      whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which
      the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nany
      link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and
      the purposes of the intended further processing;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe context in
      which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship
      between data subjects and the controller;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe nature of the personal
      data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed,
      pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions
      and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe possible
      consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe
      existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.\\n\\nArticle
      7\\n\\nConditions for consent\\n\\n1. Where processing is based on consent,
      the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented
      to processing of his or her personal data.\\n\\n2. If the data subject's consent
      is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters,
      the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable
      from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using
      clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an
      infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.\\n\\n3. The data subject
      shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal
      of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before
      its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed
      thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.\\n\\n4. When assessing
      whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter
      alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is
      conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary
      for the performance of that contract.\\n\\nArticle 8\\n\\nConditions applicable
      to child's consent in relation to information society services\\n\\n1. Where
      point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society
      services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child
      shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
      below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the
      extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility
      over the child.\\n\\nMember States may provide by law for a lower age for those
      purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years.\\n\\n2. The controller
      shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given
      or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking
      into consideration available technology.\\n\\n3. Paragraph 1 shall not affect
      the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity,
      formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child.\\n\\nArticle 9\\n\\nProcessing
      of special categories of personal data\\n\\n1. Processing of personal data revealing
      racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,
      or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data
      for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health
      or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be
      prohibited.\\n\\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal
      data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State
      law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted
      by the data subject;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for the purposes
      of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller
      or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social
      protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law or
      a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for appropriate
      safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
      natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of
      giving consent;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nprocessing is carried out in the course of its
      legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association
      or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious
      or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the
      members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact
      with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed
      outside that body without the consent of the data subjects;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nprocessing
      relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever
      courts are acting in their judicial capacity;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary
      for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member
      State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence
      of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures
      to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the
      assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision
      of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social
      care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant
      to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards
      referred to in paragraph 3;\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for reasons
      of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against
      serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality
      and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the
      basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific
      measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular
      professional secrecy;\\n\\n(j)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) based on Union or Member State law
      which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the
      right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard
      the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.\\n\\n3. Personal
      data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to
      in point (h) of paragraph 2 when those data are processed by or under the responsibility
      of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under Union
      or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies or by
      another person also subject to an obligation of secrecy under Union or Member
      State law or rules established by national competent bodies.\\n\\n4. Member
      States may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations,
      with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning
      health.\\n\\nArticle 10\\n\\nProcessing of personal data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences\\n\\nProcessing of personal data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article 6(1)
      shall be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the
      processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate
      safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any comprehensive register
      of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority.\\n\\nArticle
      11\\n\\nProcessing which does not require identification\\n\\n1. If the purposes
      for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer require
      the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall
      not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order
      to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation.\\n\\n2.
      Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is
      able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject,
      the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible. In such
      cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for
      the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional
      information enabling his or her identification.\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nRights
      of the data subject\\n\\nSection 1\\n\\nTransparency and modalities\\n\\nArticle
      12\\n\\nTransparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise
      of the rights of the data subject\\n\\n1. The controller shall take appropriate
      measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any
      communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data
      subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form,
      using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed
      specifically to a child. The information shall be provided in writing, or by
      other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested
      by the data subject, the information may be provided orally, provided that the
      identity of the data subject is proven by other means.\\n\\n2. The controller
      shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15 to 22.
      In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to
      act on the request of the data subject for exercising his or her rights under
      Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position
      to identify the data subject.\\n\\n3. The controller shall provide information
      on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without
      undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That
      period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account
      the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data
      subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together
      with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by
      electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic means
      where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.\\n\\n4. If the
      controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller
      shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month
      of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility
      of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy.\\n\\n5.
      Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any
      actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge.
      Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in
      particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ncharge
      a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the
      information or communication or taking the action requested; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nrefuse
      to act on the request.\\n\\nThe controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating
      the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.\\n\\n6. Without
      prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning
      the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles
      15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information
      necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.\\n\\n7. The information
      to be provided to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided
      in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible,
      intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended
      processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable.\\n\\n8.
      The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with
      Article 92 for the purpose of determining the information to be presented by
      the icons and the procedures for providing standardised icons.\\n\\nSection
      2\\n\\nInformation and access to personal data\\n\\nArticle 13\\n\\nInformation

      the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article
      9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting
      the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nwhether
      the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or

      Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose
      other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall
      provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on
      that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to
      in paragraph 2.\\n\\n4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar

      to Article 21(2);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe personal data have been unlawfully processed;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe
      personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union
      or Member State law to which the controller is subject;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe personal
      data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services
      referred to in Article 8(1).\\n\\n2. Where the controller has made the personal
      data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data,
      the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation,
      shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers
      which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the
      erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those
      personal data.\\n\\n3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that
      processing is necessary:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nfor exercising the right of freedom of
      expression and information;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nfor compliance with a legal obligation
      which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller
      is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nfor
      reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points
      (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nfor archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right
      referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair
      the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nfor the
      establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\\n\\nArticle 18\\n\\nRight
      to restriction of processing\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have the right to
      obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following
      applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe accuracy of the personal data is contested by the
      data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of
      the personal data;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe processing is unlawful and the data subject
      opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their
      use instead;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe controller no longer needs the personal data
      for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject
      for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the
      verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those
      of the data subject.\\n\\n2. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph
      1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed
      with the data subject's consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence
      of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
      person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member
      State.\\n\\n3. A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant
      to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of
      processing is lifted.\\n\\nArticle 19\\n\\nNotification obligation regarding
      rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing\\n\\nThe
      controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or
      restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Article 16, Article
      17(1) and Article 18 to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed,
      unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller
      shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests
      it.\\n\\nArticle 20\\n\\nRight to data portability\\n\\n1. The data subject
      shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which
      he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
      format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without
      hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided,
      where:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a)
      of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2) or on a contract pursuant to point
      (b) of Article 6(1); and\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe processing is carried out by automated
      means.\\n\\n2. In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to
      paragraph 1, the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data
      transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible.\\n\\n3.
      The exercise of the right referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be
      without prejudice to Article 17. That right shall not apply to processing necessary
      for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise
      of official authority vested in the controller.\\n\\n4. The right referred to
      in paragraph 1 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\\n\\nSection
      4\\n\\nRight to object and automated individual decision-making\\n\\nArticle
      21\\n\\nRight to object\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have the right to object,
      on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing
      of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of
      Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller
      shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates
      compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests,
      rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or
      defence of legal claims.\\n\\n2. Where personal data are processed for direct
      marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time
      to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which
      includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\\n\\n3.
      Where the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes,
      the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.\\n\\n4. At
      the latest at the time of the first communication with the data subject, the
      right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly brought to the attention
      of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other
      information.\\n\\n5. In the context of the use of information society services,
      and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his
      or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.\\n\\n6.
      Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject, on grounds
      relating to his or her particular situation, shall have the right to object
      to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
      interest.\\n\\nArticle 22\\n\\nAutomated individual decision-making, including
      profiling\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to
      a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which
      produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects
      him or her.\\n\\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nis
      necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data
      subject and a data controller;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nis authorised by Union or Member
      State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable
      measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate
      interests; or\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nis based on the data subject's explicit consent.\\n\\n3.
      In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller
      shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and
      freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention
      on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest
      the decision.\\n\\n4. Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based
      on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point
      (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data
      subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.\\n\\nSection
      5\\n\\nRestrictions\\n\\nArticle 23\\n\\nRestrictions\\n\\n1. Union or Member
      State law to which the data controller or processor is subject may restrict
      by way of a legislative measure the scope of the obligations and rights provided
      for in Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34, as well as Article 5 in so far as its
      provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles
      12 to 22, when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights
      and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society
      to safeguard:\\n\\nIt is a sunny day in Texas!\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nnational security;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ndefence;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\npublic
      security;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution
      of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding
      against and the prevention of threats to public security;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nother
      important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member
      State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union
      or of a Member State, including monetary, budgetary and taxation a matters,
      public health and social security;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe protection of judicial
      independence and judicial proceedings;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nthe prevention, investigation,
      detection and prosecution of breaches of ethics for regulated professions;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\na

      to the exercise of official authority in the cases referred to in points (a)
      to (e) and (g);\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nthe protection of the data subject or the rights
      and freedoms of others;\\n\\n(j)\\n\\nthe enforcement of civil law claims.\\n\\n2.
      In particular, any legislative measure referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain
      specific provisions at least, where relevant, as to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe purposes
      of the processing or categories of processing;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe categories
      of personal data;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe scope of the restrictions introduced;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe
      specification of the controller or categories of controllers;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe
      storage periods and the applicable safeguards taking into account the nature,
      scope and purposes of the processing or categories of processing;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nthe
      risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects; and\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nthe right
      of data subjects to be informed about the restriction, unless that may be prejudicial
      to the purpose of the restriction.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nController and processor\\n\\nSection
      1\\n\\nGeneral obligations\\n\\nArticle 24\\n\\nResponsibility of the controller\\n\\n1.
      Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as
      well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and
      organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing
      is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed
      and updated where necessary.\\n\\n2. Where proportionate in relation to processing
      activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation
      of appropriate data protection policies by the controller.\\n\\n3. Adherence
      to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification
      mechanisms as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to
      demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller.\\n\\nArticle
      25\\n\\nData protection by design and by default\\n\\n1. Taking into account
      the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context
      and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity
      for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller
      shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and
      at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational
      measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection
      principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate
      the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements
      of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.\\n\\n2. The controller
      shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring
      that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose
      of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal
      data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage
      and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default
      personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention
      to an indefinite number of natural persons.\\n\\n3. An approved certification
      mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance
      with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.\\n\\nArticle
      26\\n\\nJoint controllers\\n\\n1. Where two or more controllers jointly determine
      the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They
      shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for
      compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as regards
      the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties
      to provide the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, by means of an
      arrangement between them unless, and in so far as, the respective responsibilities
      of the controllers are determined by Union or Member State law to which the
      controllers are subject. The arrangement may designate a contact point for data
      subjects.\\n\\n2. The arrangement referred to in paragraph 1 shall duly reflect
      the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-\xE0-vis
      the data subjects. The essence of the arrangement shall be made available to
      the data subject.\\n\\n3. Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred
      to in paragraph 1, the data subject may exercise his or her rights under this
      Regulation in respect of and against each of the controllers.\\n\\nArticle 27\\n\\nRepresentatives
      of controllers or processors not established in the Union\\n\\n1. Where Article
      3(2) applies, the controller or the processor shall designate in writing a representative
      in the Union.\\n\\n2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article
      shall not apply to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nprocessing which is occasional, does not include,
      on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in
      Article 9(1) or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions
      and offences referred to in Article 10, and is unlikely to result in a risk
      to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature,
      context, scope and purposes of the processing; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\na public authority
      or body.\\n\\n3. The representative shall be established in one of the Member
      States where the data subjects, whose personal data are processed in relation
      to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored,
      are.\\n\\n4. The representative shall be mandated by the controller or processor
      to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor
      by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues
      related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\\n\\n5.
      The designation of a representative by the controller or processor shall be
      without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller
      or the processor themselves.\\n\\nArticle 28\\n\\nProcessor\\n\\n1. Where processing
      is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only
      processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical
      and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements
      of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.\\n\\n2.
      The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general
      written authorisation of the controller. In the case of general written authorisation,
      the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning
      the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller
      the opportunity to object to such changes.\\n\\n3. Processing by a processor
      shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State
      law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that
      sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose
      of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects
      and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal
      act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nprocesses
      the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including
      with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international
      organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which
      the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller
      of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such
      information on important grounds of public interest;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nensures that
      persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to
      confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\ntakes
      all measures required pursuant to Article 32;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nrespects the conditions
      referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for engaging another processor;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\ntaking
      into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate
      technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the
      fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising
      the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nassists the
      controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles
      32 to 36 taking into account the nature of processing and the information available
      to the processor;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nat the choice of the controller, deletes or
      returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision
      of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union
      or Member State law requires storage of the personal data;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nmakes
      available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance
      with the obligations laid down in this Article and allow for and contribute
      to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor
      mandated by the controller.\\n\\nWith regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph,
      the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an
      instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection
      provisions.\\n\\n4. Where a processor engages another processor for carrying
      out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data
      protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between
      the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed
      on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union
      or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement
      appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the
      processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor
      fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall
      remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's
      obligations.\\n\\n5. Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct
      as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred
      to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient
      guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article.\\n\\n6. Without
      prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor,
      the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this
      Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred
      to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a
      certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42
      and 43.\\n\\n7. The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for
      the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance
      with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).\\n\\n8. A supervisory
      authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to
      in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the consistency
      mechanism referred to in Article 63.\\n\\n9. The contract or the other legal
      act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic
      form.\\n\\n10. Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes
      this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, the processor
      shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing.\\n\\nArticle
      29\\n\\nProcessing under the authority of the controller or processor\\n\\nThe
      processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of
      the processor, who has access to personal data, shall not process those data
      except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union
      or Member State law.\\n\\nArticle 30\\n\\nRecords of processing activities\\n\\n1.
      Each controller and, where applicable, the controller's representative, shall
      maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. That record
      shall contain all of the following information:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe name and contact
      details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's
      representative and the data protection officer;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe purposes of
      the processing;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\na description of the categories of data subjects
      and of the categories of personal data;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe categories of recipients
      to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients
      in third countries or international organisations;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nwhere applicable,
      transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation,
      including the identification of that third country or international organisation
      and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article
      49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nwhere possible,
      the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nwhere
      possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security
      measures referred to in Article 32(1).\\n\\n2. Each processor and, where applicable,
      the processor's representative shall maintain a record of all categories of
      processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller, containing:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller
      on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's
      or the processor's representative, and the data protection officer;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nwhere
      applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international
      organisation, including the identification of that third country or international
      organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph
      of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nwhere
      possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security
      measures referred to in Article 32(1).\\n\\n3. The records referred to in paragraphs
      1 and 2 shall be in writing, including in electronic form.\\n\\n4. The controller
      or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's
      representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority
      on request.\\n\\n5. The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall
      not apply to an enterprise or an organisation employing fewer than 250 persons
      unless the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights
      and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is not occasional, or the processing
      includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal
      data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.\\n\\nArticle
      31\\n\\nCooperation with the supervisory authority\\n\\nThe controller and the
      processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on
      request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.\\n\\nSection
      2\\n\\nSecurity of personal data\\n\\nArticle 32\\n\\nSecurity of processing\\n\\n1.
      Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the
      nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying
      likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the
      controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
      measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter
      alia as appropriate:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe pseudonymisation and encryption of personal
      data;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity,
      availability and resilience of processing systems and services;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe
      ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely
      manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\na process
      for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical
      and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.\\n\\n2.
      In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular
      of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental
      or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access
      to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.\\n\\n3. Adherence
      to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification
      mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to
      demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this
      Article.\\n\\n4. The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that
      any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor
      who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions
      from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member
      State law.\\n\\nArticle 33\\n\\nNotification of a personal data breach to the
      supervisory authority\\n\\n1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller
      shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after
      having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
      authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data
      breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within
      72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.\\n\\n2. The processor
      shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal
      data breach.\\n\\n3. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ndescribe
      the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories
      and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate
      number of personal data records concerned;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ncommunicate the name
      and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where
      more information can be obtained;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\ndescribe the likely consequences
      of the personal data breach;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\ndescribe the measures taken or proposed
      to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including,
      where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.\\n\\n4.
      Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the
      same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay.\\n\\n5.
      The controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts
      relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken.
      That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance
      with this Article.\\n\\nArticle 34\\n\\nCommunication of a personal data breach
      to the data subject\\n\\n1. When the personal data breach is likely to result
      in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller
      shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue
      delay.\\n\\n2. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph
      1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the
      personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred
      to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).\\n\\n3. The communication to
      the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of
      the following conditions are met:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe controller has implemented
      appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures
      were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular
      those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not
      authorised to access it, such as encryption;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe controller has
      taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and
      freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to
      materialise;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nit would involve disproportionate effort. In such
      a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby
      the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.\\n\\n4. If the
      controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data
      subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the
      personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may
      decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.\\n\\nSection
      3\\n\\nData protection impact assessment and prior consultation\\n\\nArticle
      35\\n\\nData protection impact assessment\\n\\n1. Where a type of processing
      in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope,
      context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the
      processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing
      operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address
      a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.\\n\\n2.
      The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated,
      when carrying out a data protection impact assessment.\\n\\n3. A data protection
      impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required
      in the case of:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\na systematic and extensive evaluation of personal
      aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing,
      including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects
      concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural
      person;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprocessing on a large scale of special categories of data
      referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions
      and offences referred to in Article 10; or\\n\\n(c)\\n\\na systematic monitoring
      of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.\\n\\n4. The supervisory authority
      shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations
      which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment
      pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists
      to the Board referred to in Article 68.\\n\\n5. The supervisory authority may
      also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for
      which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority
      shall communicate those lists to the Board.\\n\\n6. Prior to the adoption of
      the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority
      shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists
      involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or
      services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several
      Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data
      within the Union.\\n\\n7. The assessment shall contain at least:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\na
      systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes
      of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued
      by the controller;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nan assessment of the necessity and proportionality
      of the processing operations in relation to the purposes;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nan assessment
      of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph
      1; and\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe measures envisaged to address the risks, including
      safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal
      data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account
      the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.\\n\\n8.
      Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant
      controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact
      of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in
      particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment.\\n\\n9.
      Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their
      representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection
      of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.\\n\\n10.
      Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis
      in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject,
      that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in
      question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out
      as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that
      legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it
      to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities.\\n\\n11.
      Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing
      is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least
      when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations.\\n\\nArticle
      36\\n\\nPrior consultation\\n\\n1. The controller shall consult the supervisory
      authority prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment under
      Article 35 indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the
      absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.\\n\\n2. Where
      the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended processing referred
      to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in particular where the controller
      has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the supervisory authority
      shall, within period of up to eight weeks of receipt of the request for consultation,
      provide written advice to the controller and, where applicable to the processor,
      and may use any of its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be
      extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing.
      The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and, where applicable,
      the processor, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request
      for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may
      be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained information it has
      requested for the purposes of the consultation.\\n\\n3. When consulting the
      supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1, the controller shall provide
      the supervisory authority with:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nwhere applicable, the respective
      responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved
      in the processing, in particular for processing within a group of undertakings;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      purposes and means of the intended processing;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe measures and
      safeguards provided to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects pursuant
      to this Regulation;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nwhere applicable, the contact details of the
      data protection officer;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe data protection impact assessment
      provided for in Article 35; and\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nany other information requested
      by the supervisory authority.\\n\\n4. Member States shall consult the supervisory
      authority during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to
      be adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such
      a legislative measure, which relates to processing.\\n\\n5. Notwithstanding
      paragraph 1, Member State law may require controllers to consult with, and obtain
      prior authorisation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing
      by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller
      in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection
      and public health.\\n\\nSection 4\\n\\nData protection officer\\n\\nArticle
      37\\n\\nDesignation of the data protection officer\\n\\n1. The controller and
      the processor shall designate a data protection officer in any case where:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting
      in their judicial capacity;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe core activities of the controller
      or the processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their
      nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring
      of data subjects on a large scale; or\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe core activities of the
      controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special
      categories of data pursuant to Article 9 and personal data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.\\n\\n2. A group of undertakings
      may appoint a single data protection officer provided that a data protection
      officer is easily accessible from each establishment.\\n\\n3. Where the controller
      or the processor is a public authority or body, a single data protection officer
      may be designated for several such authorities or bodies, taking account of
      their organisational structure and size.\\n</document_text>\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\"max_tokens\":4096,\"stream\":false,\"temperature\":0.3,\"top_p\":0.3}"

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow

      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the

      State law to which the controller is subject.\\n\\nThe purpose of the processing
      shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred
      to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a
      task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
      vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to
      adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions
      governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data
      which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities
      to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose
      limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures,
      including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other
      specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the
      Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate
      to the legitimate aim pursued.\\n\\n4. Where the processing for a purpose other
      than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the
      data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a
      necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the
      objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain
      whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which
      the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nany
      link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and
      the purposes of the intended further processing;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe context in
      which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship
      between data subjects and the controller;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe nature of the personal
      data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed,
      pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions
      and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe possible
      consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe
      existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.\\n\\nArticle
      7\\n\\nConditions for consent\\n\\n1. Where processing is based on consent,
      the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented
      to processing of his or her personal data.\\n\\n2. If the data subject's consent
      is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters,
      the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable
      from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using
      clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an
      infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.\\n\\n3. The data subject
      shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal
      of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before
      its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed
      thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.\\n\\n4. When assessing
      whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter
      alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is
      conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary
      for the performance of that contract.\\n\\nArticle 8\\n\\nConditions applicable
      to child's consent in relation to information society services\\n\\n1. Where
      point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society
      services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child
      shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
      below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the
      extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility
      over the child.\\n\\nMember States may provide by law for a lower age for those
      purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years.\\n\\n2. The controller
      shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given
      or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking
      into consideration available technology.\\n\\n3. Paragraph 1 shall not affect
      the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity,
      formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child.\\n\\nArticle 9\\n\\nProcessing
      of special categories of personal data\\n\\n1. Processing of personal data revealing
      racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,
      or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data
      for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health
      or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be
      prohibited.\\n\\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal
      data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State
      law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted
      by the data subject;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for the purposes
      of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller
      or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social
      protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law or
      a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for appropriate
      safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
      natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of
      giving consent;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nprocessing is carried out in the course of its
      legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association
      or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious
      or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the
      members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact
      with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed
      outside that body without the consent of the data subjects;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nprocessing
      relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever
      courts are acting in their judicial capacity;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary
      for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member
      State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence
      of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures
      to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nprocessing
      is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the
      assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision
      of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social
      care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant
      to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards
      referred to in paragraph 3;\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for reasons
      of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against
      serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality
      and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the
      basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific
      measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular
      professional secrecy;\\n\\n(j)\\n\\nprocessing is necessary for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
      purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) based on Union or Member State law
      which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the
      right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard
      the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.\\n\\n3. Personal
      data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to
      in point (h) of paragraph 2 when those data are processed by or under the responsibility
      of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under Union
      or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies or by
      another person also subject to an obligation of secrecy under Union or Member
      State law or rules established by national competent bodies.\\n\\n4. Member
      States may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations,
      with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning
      health.\\n\\nArticle 10\\n\\nProcessing of personal data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences\\n\\nProcessing of personal data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article 6(1)
      shall be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the
      processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate
      safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any comprehensive register
      of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority.\\n\\nArticle
      11\\n\\nProcessing which does not require identification\\n\\n1. If the purposes
      for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer require
      the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall
      not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order
      to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation.\\n\\n2.
      Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is
      able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject,
      the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible. In such
      cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for
      the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional
      information enabling his or her identification.\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nRights
      of the data subject\\n\\nSection 1\\n\\nTransparency and modalities\\n\\nArticle
      12\\n\\nTransparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise
      of the rights of the data subject\\n\\n1. The controller shall take appropriate
      measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any
      communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data
      subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form,
      using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed
      specifically to a child. The information shall be provided in writing, or by
      other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested
      by the data subject, the information may be provided orally, provided that the
      identity of the data subject is proven by other means.\\n\\n2. The controller
      shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15 to 22.
      In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to
      act on the request of the data subject for exercising his or her rights under
      Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position
      to identify the data subject.\\n\\n3. The controller shall provide information
      on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without
      undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That
      period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account
      the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data
      subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together
      with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by
      electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic means
      where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.\\n\\n4. If the
      controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller
      shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month
      of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility
      of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy.\\n\\n5.
      Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any
      actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge.
      Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in
      particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ncharge
      a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the
      information or communication or taking the action requested; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nrefuse
      to act on the request.\\n\\nThe controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating
      the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.\\n\\n6. Without
      prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning
      the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles
      15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information
      necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.\\n\\n7. The information
      to be provided to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided
      in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible,
      intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended
      processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable.\\n\\n8.
      The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with
      Article 92 for the purpose of determining the information to be presented by
      the icons and the procedures for providing standardised icons.\\n\\nSection
      2\\n\\nInformation and access to personal data\\n\\nArticle 13\\n\\nInformation

      to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a
      copy of them or where they have been made available.\\n\\n2. In addition to
      the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time
      when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following
      further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe

      the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article
      9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting
      the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nwhether

      Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose
      other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall
      provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on
      that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to
      in paragraph 2.\\n\\n4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar

      are to be used for communication with the data subject, at the latest at the
      time of the first communication to that data subject; or\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nif a
      disclosure to another recipient is envisaged, at the latest when the personal
      data are first disclosed.\\n\\n4. Where the controller intends to further process
      the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data
      were obtained, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further
      processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further
      information as referred to in paragraph 2.\\n\\n5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not
      apply where and insofar as:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe data subject already has the information;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate
      effort, in particular for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest,
      scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, subject
      to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1) or in so far as
      the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to render
      impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing.
      In such cases the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the
      data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making
      the information publicly available;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nobtaining or disclosure is
      expressly laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is
      subject and which provides appropriate measures to protect the data subject's
      legitimate interests; or\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nwhere the personal data must remain confidential
      subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by Union or Member
      State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.\\n\\nArticle 15\\n\\nRight
      of access by the data subject\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have the right
      to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data
      concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access
      to the personal data and the following information:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe purposes
      of the processing;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe categories of personal data concerned;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe
      recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or
      will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international
      organisations;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nwhere possible, the envisaged period for which
      the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to
      determine that period;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe existence of the right to request from
      the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing
      of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe
      right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nwhere
      the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information
      as to their source;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nthe existence of automated decision-making,
      including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those
      cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance
      and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\\n\\n2.
      Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international
      organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate
      safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer.\\n\\n3. The controller
      shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further
      copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable
      fee based on administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request
      by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the
      information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form.\\n\\n4. The
      right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not adversely affect
      the rights and freedoms of others.\\n\\nSection 3\\n\\nRectification and erasure\\n\\nArticle
      16\\n\\nRight to rectification\\n\\nThe data subject shall have the right to
      obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate
      personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the
      processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal
      data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\\n\\nArticle
      17\\n\\nRight to erasure (\u2018right to be forgotten\u2019)\\n\\n1. The data
      subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal
      data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have
      the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following
      grounds applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe personal data are no longer necessary in
      relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to
      point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is
      no other legal ground for the processing;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe data subject objects
      to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate
      grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant
      to Article 21(2);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe personal data have been unlawfully processed;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe
      personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union
      or Member State law to which the controller is subject;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe personal
      data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services
      referred to in Article 8(1).\\n\\n2. Where the controller has made the personal
      data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data,
      the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation,
      shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers
      which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the
      erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those
      personal data.\\n\\n3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that
      processing is necessary:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nfor exercising the right of freedom of
      expression and information;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nfor compliance with a legal obligation
      which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller
      is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nfor
      reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points
      (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nfor archiving
      purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right
      referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair
      the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nfor the
      establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\\n\\nArticle 18\\n\\nRight
      to restriction of processing\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have the right to
      obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following
      applies:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe accuracy of the personal data is contested by the
      data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of
      the personal data;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe processing is unlawful and the data subject
      opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their
      use instead;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe controller no longer needs the personal data
      for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject
      for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the
      verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those
      of the data subject.\\n\\n2. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph
      1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed
      with the data subject's consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence
      of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
      person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member
      State.\\n\\n3. A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant
      to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of
      processing is lifted.\\n\\nArticle 19\\n\\nNotification obligation regarding
      rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing\\n\\nThe
      controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or
      restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Article 16, Article
      17(1) and Article 18 to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed,
      unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller
      shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests
      it.\\n\\nArticle 20\\n\\nRight to data portability\\n\\n1. The data subject
      shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which
      he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
      format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without
      hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided,
      where:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a)
      of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2) or on a contract pursuant to point
      (b) of Article 6(1); and\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe processing is carried out by automated
      means.\\n\\n2. In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to
      paragraph 1, the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data
      transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible.\\n\\n3.
      The exercise of the right referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be
      without prejudice to Article 17. That right shall not apply to processing necessary
      for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise
      of official authority vested in the controller.\\n\\n4. The right referred to
      in paragraph 1 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\\n\\nSection
      4\\n\\nRight to object and automated individual decision-making\\n\\nArticle
      21\\n\\nRight to object\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have the right to object,
      on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing
      of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of
      Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller
      shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates
      compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests,
      rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or
      defence of legal claims.\\n\\n2. Where personal data are processed for direct
      marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time
      to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which
      includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\\n\\n3.
      Where the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes,
      the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.\\n\\n4. At
      the latest at the time of the first communication with the data subject, the
      right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly brought to the attention
      of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other
      information.\\n\\n5. In the context of the use of information society services,
      and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his
      or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.\\n\\n6.
      Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject, on grounds
      relating to his or her particular situation, shall have the right to object
      to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing
      is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
      interest.\\n\\nArticle 22\\n\\nAutomated individual decision-making, including
      profiling\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to
      a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which
      produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects
      him or her.\\n\\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nis
      necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data
      subject and a data controller;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nis authorised by Union or Member
      State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable
      measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate
      interests; or\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nis based on the data subject's explicit consent.\\n\\n3.
      In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller
      shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and
      freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention
      on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest
      the decision.\\n\\n4. Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based
      on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point
      (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data
      subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.\\n\\nSection
      5\\n\\nRestrictions\\n\\nArticle 23\\n\\nRestrictions\\n\\n1. Union or Member
      State law to which the data controller or processor is subject may restrict
      by way of a legislative measure the scope of the obligations and rights provided
      for in Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34, as well as Article 5 in so far as its
      provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles
      12 to 22, when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights
      and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society
      to safeguard:\\n\\nIt is a sunny day in Texas!\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nnational security;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ndefence;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\npublic
      security;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution
      of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding
      against and the prevention of threats to public security;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nother
      important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member
      State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union
      or of a Member State, including monetary, budgetary and taxation a matters,
      public health and social security;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe protection of judicial
      independence and judicial proceedings;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nthe prevention, investigation,
      detection and prosecution of breaches of ethics for regulated professions;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\na

      to the exercise of official authority in the cases referred to in points (a)
      to (e) and (g);\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nthe protection of the data subject or the rights
      and freedoms of others;\\n\\n(j)\\n\\nthe enforcement of civil law claims.\\n\\n2.
      In particular, any legislative measure referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain
      specific provisions at least, where relevant, as to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe purposes
      of the processing or categories of processing;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe categories
      of personal data;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe scope of the restrictions introduced;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe
      specification of the controller or categories of controllers;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe
      storage periods and the applicable safeguards taking into account the nature,

      risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects; and\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nthe right
      of data subjects to be informed about the restriction, unless that may be prejudicial
      to the purpose of the restriction.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nController and processor\\n\\nSection
      1\\n\\nGeneral obligations\\n\\nArticle 24\\n\\nResponsibility of the controller\\n\\n1.
      Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as
      well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms
      of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and
      organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing
      is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed
      and updated where necessary.\\n\\n2. Where proportionate in relation to processing
      activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation
      of appropriate data protection policies by the controller.\\n\\n3. Adherence
      to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification
      mechanisms as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to
      demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller.\\n\\nArticle
      25\\n\\nData protection by design and by default\\n\\n1. Taking into account
      the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context
      and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity
      for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller
      shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and
      at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational
      measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection
      principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate
      the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements
      of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.\\n\\n2. The controller
      shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring
      that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose
      of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal
      data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage
      and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default
      personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention
      to an indefinite number of natural persons.\\n\\n3. An approved certification
      mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance
      with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.\\n\\nArticle
      26\\n\\nJoint controllers\\n\\n1. Where two or more controllers jointly determine
      the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They
      shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for
      compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as regards
      the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties
      to provide the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, by means of an
      arrangement between them unless, and in so far as, the respective responsibilities
      of the controllers are determined by Union or Member State law to which the
      controllers are subject. The arrangement may designate a contact point for data
      subjects.\\n\\n2. The arrangement referred to in paragraph 1 shall duly reflect
      the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-\xE0-vis
      the data subjects. The essence of the arrangement shall be made available to
      the data subject.\\n\\n3. Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred
      to in paragraph 1, the data subject may exercise his or her rights under this
      Regulation in respect of and against each of the controllers.\\n\\nArticle 27\\n\\nRepresentatives
      of controllers or processors not established in the Union\\n\\n1. Where Article
      3(2) applies, the controller or the processor shall designate in writing a representative
      in the Union.\\n\\n2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article
      shall not apply to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nprocessing which is occasional, does not include,
      on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in
      Article 9(1) or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions
      and offences referred to in Article 10, and is unlikely to result in a risk
      to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature,
      context, scope and purposes of the processing; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\na public authority
      or body.\\n\\n3. The representative shall be established in one of the Member
      States where the data subjects, whose personal data are processed in relation
      to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored,
      are.\\n\\n4. The representative shall be mandated by the controller or processor
      to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor
      by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues
      related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\\n\\n5.
      The designation of a representative by the controller or processor shall be
      without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller
      or the processor themselves.\\n\\nArticle 28\\n\\nProcessor\\n\\n1. Where processing
      is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only
      processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical
      and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements
      of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.\\n\\n2.
      The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general
      written authorisation of the controller. In the case of general written authorisation,
      the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning
      the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller
      the opportunity to object to such changes.\\n\\n3. Processing by a processor
      shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State
      law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that
      sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose
      of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects
      and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal
      act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nprocesses
      the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including
      with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international
      organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which
      the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller
      of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such
      information on important grounds of public interest;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nensures that
      persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to
      confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\ntakes
      all measures required pursuant to Article 32;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nrespects the conditions
      referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for engaging another processor;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\ntaking
      into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate
      technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the
      fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising
      the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nassists the
      controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles
      32 to 36 taking into account the nature of processing and the information available
      to the processor;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nat the choice of the controller, deletes or
      returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision
      of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union
      or Member State law requires storage of the personal data;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nmakes
      available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance
      with the obligations laid down in this Article and allow for and contribute
      to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor
      mandated by the controller.\\n\\nWith regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph,
      the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an
      instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection
      provisions.\\n\\n4. Where a processor engages another processor for carrying
      out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data
      protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between
      the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed
      on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union
      or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement
      appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the
      processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor
      fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall
      remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's
      obligations.\\n\\n5. Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct
      as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred
      to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient
      guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article.\\n\\n6. Without
      prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor,
      the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this
      Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred
      to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a
      certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42
      and 43.\\n\\n7. The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for
      the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance
      with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).\\n\\n8. A supervisory
      authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to
      in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the consistency
      mechanism referred to in Article 63.\\n\\n9. The contract or the other legal
      act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic
      form.\\n\\n10. Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes
      this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, the processor
      shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing.\\n\\nArticle
      29\\n\\nProcessing under the authority of the controller or processor\\n\\nThe
      processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of
      the processor, who has access to personal data, shall not process those data
      except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union
      or Member State law.\\n\\nArticle 30\\n\\nRecords of processing activities\\n\\n1.
      Each controller and, where applicable, the controller's representative, shall
      maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. That record
      shall contain all of the following information:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe name and contact
      details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's
      representative and the data protection officer;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe purposes of
      the processing;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\na description of the categories of data subjects
      and of the categories of personal data;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe categories of recipients
      to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients
      in third countries or international organisations;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nwhere applicable,
      transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation,
      including the identification of that third country or international organisation
      and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article
      49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nwhere possible,
      the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nwhere
      possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security
      measures referred to in Article 32(1).\\n\\n2. Each processor and, where applicable,
      the processor's representative shall maintain a record of all categories of
      processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller, containing:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller
      on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's
      or the processor's representative, and the data protection officer;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nwhere
      applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international
      organisation, including the identification of that third country or international
      organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph
      of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nwhere
      possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security
      measures referred to in Article 32(1).\\n\\n3. The records referred to in paragraphs
      1 and 2 shall be in writing, including in electronic form.\\n\\n4. The controller
      or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's
      representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority
      on request.\\n\\n5. The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall
      not apply to an enterprise or an organisation employing fewer than 250 persons
      unless the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights
      and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is not occasional, or the processing
      includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal
      data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.\\n\\nArticle
      31\\n\\nCooperation with the supervisory authority\\n\\nThe controller and the
      processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on
      request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.\\n\\nSection
      2\\n\\nSecurity of personal data\\n\\nArticle 32\\n\\nSecurity of processing\\n\\n1.
      Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the
      nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying
      likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the
      controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
      measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter
      alia as appropriate:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe pseudonymisation and encryption of personal
      data;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity,
      availability and resilience of processing systems and services;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe
      ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely
      manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\na process
      for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical
      and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.\\n\\n2.
      In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular
      of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental
      or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access
      to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.\\n\\n3. Adherence
      to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification
      mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to
      demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this
      Article.\\n\\n4. The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that
      any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor
      who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions
      from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member
      State law.\\n\\nArticle 33\\n\\nNotification of a personal data breach to the
      supervisory authority\\n\\n1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller
      shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after
      having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
      authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data
      breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
      persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within
      72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.\\n\\n2. The processor
      shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal
      data breach.\\n\\n3. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ndescribe
      the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories
      and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate
      number of personal data records concerned;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ncommunicate the name
      and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where
      more information can be obtained;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\ndescribe the likely consequences
      of the personal data breach;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\ndescribe the measures taken or proposed
      to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including,
      where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.\\n\\n4.
      Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the
      same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay.\\n\\n5.
      The controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts
      relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken.
      That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance
      with this Article.\\n\\nArticle 34\\n\\nCommunication of a personal data breach
      to the data subject\\n\\n1. When the personal data breach is likely to result
      in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller
      shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue
      delay.\\n\\n2. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph
      1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the
      personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred
      to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).\\n\\n3. The communication to
      the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of
      the following conditions are met:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe controller has implemented
      appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures
      were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular
      those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not
      authorised to access it, such as encryption;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe controller has
      taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and
      freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to
      materialise;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nit would involve disproportionate effort. In such
      a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby
      the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.\\n\\n4. If the
      controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data
      subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the
      personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may
      decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.\\n\\nSection
      3\\n\\nData protection impact assessment and prior consultation\\n\\nArticle
      35\\n\\nData protection impact assessment\\n\\n1. Where a type of processing
      in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope,
      context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to
      the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the
      processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing
      operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address
      a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.\\n\\n2.
      The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated,
      when carrying out a data protection impact assessment.\\n\\n3. A data protection
      impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required
      in the case of:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\na systematic and extensive evaluation of personal
      aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing,
      including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects
      concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural
      person;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprocessing on a large scale of special categories of data
      referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions
      and offences referred to in Article 10; or\\n\\n(c)\\n\\na systematic monitoring
      of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.\\n\\n4. The supervisory authority
      shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations
      which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment
      pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists
      to the Board referred to in Article 68.\\n\\n5. The supervisory authority may
      also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for
      which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority
      shall communicate those lists to the Board.\\n\\n6. Prior to the adoption of
      the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority
      shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists
      involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or
      services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several
      Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data
      within the Union.\\n\\n7. The assessment shall contain at least:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\na
      systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes
      of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued
      by the controller;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nan assessment of the necessity and proportionality
      of the processing operations in relation to the purposes;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nan assessment
      of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph
      1; and\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe measures envisaged to address the risks, including
      safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal
      data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account
      the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.\\n\\n8.
      Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant
      controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact
      of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in
      particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment.\\n\\n9.
      Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their
      representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection
      of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.\\n\\n10.
      Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis
      in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject,
      that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in
      question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out
      as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that
      legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it
      to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities.\\n\\n11.
      Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing
      is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least
      when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations.\\n\\nArticle
      36\\n\\nPrior consultation\\n\\n1. The controller shall consult the supervisory
      authority prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment under
      Article 35 indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the
      absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.\\n\\n2. Where
      the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended processing referred
      to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in particular where the controller
      has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the supervisory authority
      shall, within period of up to eight weeks of receipt of the request for consultation,
      provide written advice to the controller and, where applicable to the processor,
      and may use any of its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be
      extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing.
      The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and, where applicable,
      the processor, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request
      for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may
      be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained information it has
      requested for the purposes of the consultation.\\n\\n3. When consulting the
      supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1, the controller shall provide
      the supervisory authority with:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nwhere applicable, the respective
      responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved
      in the processing, in particular for processing within a group of undertakings;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      purposes and means of the intended processing;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe measures and
      safeguards provided to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects pursuant
      to this Regulation;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nwhere applicable, the contact details of the
      data protection officer;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe data protection impact assessment
      provided for in Article 35; and\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nany other information requested
      by the supervisory authority.\\n\\n4. Member States shall consult the supervisory
      authority during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to
      be adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such
      a legislative measure, which relates to processing.\\n\\n5. Notwithstanding
      paragraph 1, Member State law may require controllers to consult with, and obtain
      prior authorisation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing
      by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller
      in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection
      and public health.\\n\\nSection 4\\n\\nData protection officer\\n\\nArticle
      37\\n\\nDesignation of the data protection officer\\n\\n1. The controller and
      the processor shall designate a data protection officer in any case where:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting
      in their judicial capacity;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe core activities of the controller
      or the processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their
      nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring
      of data subjects on a large scale; or\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe core activities of the
      controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special
      categories of data pursuant to Article 9 and personal data relating to criminal
      convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.\\n\\n2. A group of undertakings
      may appoint a single data protection officer provided that a data protection
      officer is easily accessible from each establishment.\\n\\n3. Where the controller
      or the processor is a public authority or body, a single data protection officer
      may be designated for several such authorities or bodies, taking account of
      their organisational structure and size.\\n</document_text>\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\"max_tokens\":4096,\"stream\":false,\"temperature\":0.3,\"top_p\":0.3}"

      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --

      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.

      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n

      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n

      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content

      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>

      40\\n\\nCodes of conduct\\n\\n1. The Member States, the supervisory authorities,
      the Board and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct
      intended to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking
      account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and the specific
      needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\\n\\n2. Associations and
      other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may prepare
      codes of conduct, or amend or extend such codes, for the purpose of specifying
      the application of this Regulation, such as with regard to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nfair
      and transparent processing;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe legitimate interests pursued by
      controllers in specific contexts;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe collection of personal data;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe

      proceedings and other dispute resolution procedures for resolving disputes between
      controllers and data subjects with regard to processing, without prejudice to
      the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 77 and 79.\\n\\n3. In addition
      to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, codes
      of conduct approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article and having general
      validity pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article may also be adhered to by controllers
      or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3
      in order to provide appropriate safeguards within the framework of personal
      data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms
      referred to in point (e) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall
      make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding
      instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards including with regard to
      the rights of data subjects.\\n\\n4. A code of conduct referred to in paragraph
      2 of this Article shall contain mechanisms which enable the body referred to
      in Article 41(1) to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with its
      provisions by the controllers or processors which undertake to apply it, without
      prejudice to the tasks and powers of supervisory authorities competent pursuant
      to Article 55 or 56.\\n\\n5. Associations and other bodies referred to in paragraph
      2 of this Article which intend to prepare a code of conduct or to amend or extend
      an existing code shall submit the draft code, amendment or extension to the
      supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55. The supervisory
      authority shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension
      complies with this Regulation and shall approve that draft code, amendment or
      extension if it finds that it provides sufficient appropriate safeguards.\\n\\n6.
      Where the draft code, or amendment or extension is approved in accordance with
      paragraph 5, and where the code of conduct concerned does not relate to processing
      activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority shall register
      and publish the code.\\n\\n7. Where a draft code of conduct relates to processing
      activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority which is competent
      pursuant to Article 55 shall, before approving the draft code, amendment or
      extension, submit it in the procedure referred to in Article 63 to the Board
      which shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension
      complies with this Regulation or, in the situation referred to in paragraph
      3 of this Article, provides appropriate safeguards.\\n\\n8. Where the opinion
      referred to in paragraph 7 confirms that the draft code, amendment or extension
      complies with this Regulation, or, in the situation referred to in paragraph
      3, provides appropriate safeguards, the Board shall submit its opinion to the
      Commission.\\n\\n9. The Commission may, by way of implementing acts, decide
      that the approved code of conduct, amendment or extension submitted to it pursuant
      to paragraph 8 of this Article have general validity within the Union. Those
      implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure
      set out in Article 93(2).\\n\\n10. The Commission shall ensure appropriate publicity
      for the approved codes which have been decided as having general validity in
      accordance with paragraph 9.\\n\\n11. The Board shall collate all approved codes
      of conduct, amendments and extensions in a register and shall make them publicly
      available by way of appropriate means.\\n\\nArticle 41\\n\\nMonitoring of approved
      codes of conduct\\n\\n1. Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent
      supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, the monitoring of compliance
      with a code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 may be carried out by a body which
      has an appropriate level of expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the
      code and is accredited for that purpose by the competent supervisory authority.\\n\\n2.
      A body as referred to in paragraph 1 may be accredited to monitor compliance
      with a code of conduct where that body has:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ndemonstrated its independence
      and expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the code to the satisfaction
      of the competent supervisory authority;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nestablished procedures
      which allow it to assess the eligibility of controllers and processors concerned
      to apply the code, to monitor their compliance with its provisions and to periodically
      review its operation;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nestablished procedures and structures to
      handle complaints about infringements of the code or the manner in which the
      code has been, or is being, implemented by a controller or processor, and to
      make those procedures and structures transparent to data subjects and the public;
      and\\n\\n(d)\\n\\ndemonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory
      authority that its tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.\\n\\n3.
      The competent supervisory authority shall submit the draft criteria for accreditation
      of a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to the Board pursuant
      to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.\\n\\n4. Without prejudice
      to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority and the provisions
      of Chapter VIII, a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall,
      subject to appropriate safeguards, take appropriate action in cases of infringement
      of the code by a controller or processor, including suspension or exclusion
      of the controller or processor concerned from the code. It shall inform the
      competent supervisory authority of such actions and the reasons for taking them.\\n\\n5.
      The competent supervisory authority shall revoke the accreditation of a body
      as referred to in paragraph 1 if the conditions for accreditation are not, or
      are no longer, met or where actions taken by the body infringe this Regulation.\\n\\n6.
      This Article shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities
      and bodies.\\n\\nArticle 42\\n\\nCertification\\n\\n1. The Member States, the
      supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage, in particular
      at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms
      and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance
      with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors.
      The specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises shall be taken
      into account.\\n\\n2. In addition to adherence by controllers or processors
      subject to this Regulation, data protection certification mechanisms, seals
      or marks approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article may be established
      for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of appropriate safeguards provided
      by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant
      to Article 3 within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries
      or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (f) of Article
      46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments,
      via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate
      safeguards, including with regard to the rights of data subjects.\\n\\n3. The
      certification shall be voluntary and available via a process that is transparent.\\n\\n4.
      A certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the responsibility
      of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regulation and is
      without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities which
      are competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56.\\n\\n5. A certification pursuant
      to this Article shall be issued by the certification bodies referred to in Article
      43 or by the competent supervisory authority, on the basis of criteria approved
      by that competent supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(3) or by the
      Board pursuant to Article 63. Where the criteria are approved by the Board,
      this may result in a common certification, the European Data Protection Seal.\\n\\n6.
      The controller or processor which submits its processing to the certification
      mechanism shall provide the certification body referred to in Article 43, or
      where applicable, the competent supervisory authority, with all information
      and access to its processing activities which are necessary to conduct the certification
      procedure.\\n\\n7. Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor
      for a maximum period of three years and may be renewed, under the same conditions,
      provided that the relevant requirements continue to be met. Certification shall
      be withdrawn, as applicable, by the certification bodies referred to in Article
      43 or by the competent supervisory authority where the requirements for the
      certification are not or are no longer met.\\n\\n8. The Board shall collate
      all certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks in a register
      and shall make them publicly available by any appropriate means.\\n\\nArticle
      43\\n\\nCertification bodies\\n\\n1. Without prejudice to the tasks and powers
      of the competent supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, certification
      bodies which have an appropriate level of expertise in relation to data protection
      shall, after informing the supervisory authority in order to allow it to exercise
      its powers pursuant to point (h) of Article 58(2) where necessary, issue and
      renew certification. Member States shall ensure that those certification bodies
      are accredited by one or both of the following:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe supervisory
      authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      national accreditation body named in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008

      to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority, that their tasks
      and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.\\n\\n3. The accreditation

      appropriate means.\\n\\n7. Without prejudice to Chapter VIII, the competent
      supervisory authority or the national accreditation body shall revoke an accreditation
      of a certification body pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article where the conditions
      for the accreditation are not, or are no longer, met or where actions taken

      countries or international organisations\\n\\nArticle 44\\n\\nGeneral principle
      for transfers\\n\\nAny transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing
      or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international
      organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this
      Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the
      controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from
      the third country or an international organisation to another third country
      or to another international organisation. All provisions in this Chapter shall
      be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons
      guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined.\\n\\nArticle 45\\n\\nTransfers
      on the basis of an adequacy decision\\n\\n1. A transfer of personal data to
      a third country or an international organisation may take place where the Commission
      has decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors
      within that third country, or the international organisation in question ensures
      an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any specific
      authorisation.\\n\\n2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection,
      the Commission shall, in particular, take account of the following elements:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, relevant legislation,
      both general and sectoral, including concerning public security, defence, national
      security and criminal law and the access of public authorities to personal data,
      as well as the implementation of such legislation, data protection rules, professional
      rules and security measures, including rules for the onward transfer of personal
      data to another third country or international organisation which are complied
      with in that country or international organisation, case-law, as well as effective
      and enforceable data subject rights and effective administrative and judicial
      redress for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities
      in the third country or to which an international organisation is subject, with
      responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with the data protection
      rules, including adequate enforcement powers, for assisting and advising the
      data subjects in exercising their rights and for cooperation with the supervisory
      authorities of the Member States; and\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe international commitments
      the third country or international organisation concerned has entered into,
      or other obligations arising from legally binding conventions or instruments
      as well as from its participation in multilateral or regional systems, in particular
      in relation to the protection of personal data.\\n\\n3. The Commission, after
      assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, may decide, by means of implementing
      act, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within
      a third country, or an international organisation ensures an adequate level
      of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing
      act shall provide for a mechanism for a periodic review, at least every four
      years, which shall take into account all relevant developments in the third
      country or international organisation. The implementing act shall specify its
      territorial and sectoral application and, where applicable, identify the supervisory
      authority or authorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article.
      The implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure
      referred to in Article 93(2).\\n\\n4. The Commission shall, on an ongoing basis,
      monitor developments in third countries and international organisations that
      could affect the functioning of decisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 of
      this Article and decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive
      95/46/EC.\\n\\n5. The Commission shall, where available information reveals,
      in particular following the review referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article,
      that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a
      third country, or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate
      level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the
      extent necessary, repeal, amend or suspend the decision referred to in paragraph
      3 of this Article by means of implementing acts without retro-active effect.
      Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination
      procedure referred to in Article 93(2).\\n\\nOn duly justified imperative grounds
      of urgency, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts
      in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 93(3).\\n\\n6. The Commission
      shall enter into consultations with the third country or international organisation
      with a view to remedying the situation giving rise to the decision made pursuant
      to paragraph 5.\\n\\n7. A decision pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article is
      without prejudice to transfers of personal data to the third country, a territory
      or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international
      organisation in question pursuant to Articles 46 to 49.\\n\\n8. The Commission
      shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union and on its website
      a list of the third countries, territories and specified sectors within a third
      country and international organisations for which it has decided that an adequate
      level of protection is or is no longer ensured.\\n\\n9. Decisions adopted by
      the Commission on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain
      in force until amended, replaced or repealed by a Commission Decision adopted
      in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5 of this Article.\\n\\nArticle 46\\n\\nTransfers
      subject to appropriate safeguards\\n\\n1. In the absence of a decision pursuant
      to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a
      third country or an international organisation only if the controller or processor
      has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data
      subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available.\\n\\n2.
      The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may be provided for, without
      requiring any specific authorisation from a supervisory authority, by:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\na
      legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nbinding

      Subject to the authorisation from the competent supervisory authority, the appropriate
      safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may also be provided for, in particular,
      by:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ncontractual clauses between the controller or processor and
      the controller, processor or the recipient of the personal data in the third
      country or international organisation; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprovisions to be inserted
      into administrative arrangements between public authorities or bodies which
      include enforceable and effective data subject rights.\\n\\n4. The supervisory
      authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 in
      the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.\\n\\n5. Authorisations
      by a Member State or supervisory authority on the basis of Article 26(2) of
      Directive 95/46/EC shall remain valid until amended, replaced or repealed, if
      necessary, by that supervisory authority. Decisions adopted by the Commission
      on the basis of Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until
      amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission Decision adopted
      in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.\\n\\nArticle 47\\n\\nBinding

      safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including binding corporate rules, a transfer
      or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country or an international
      organisation shall take place only on one of the following conditions:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having
      been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the data subject due
      to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject
      and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at

      or by any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, but only to the
      extent that the conditions laid down by Union or Member State law for consultation
      are fulfilled in the particular case.\\n\\nWhere a transfer could not be based
      on a provision in Article 45 or 46, including the provisions on binding corporate
      rules, and none of the derogations for a specific situation referred to in the
      first subparagraph of this paragraph is applicable, a transfer to a third country
      or an international organisation may take place only if the transfer is not
      repetitive, concerns only a limited number of data subjects, is necessary for
      the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which
      are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject,
      and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer
      and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard
      to the protection of personal data. The controller shall inform the supervisory
      authority of the transfer. The controller shall, in addition to providing the

      request of those persons or if they are to be the recipients.\\n\\n3. Points
      (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and the second subparagraph

      reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to the transfer of specific
      categories of personal data to a third country or an international organisation.
      Member States shall notify such provisions to the Commission.\\n\\n6. The controller
      or processor shall document the assessment as well as the suitable safeguards

      and consistency\\n\\nSection 1\\n\\nCooperation\\n\\nArticle 60\\n\\nCooperation
      between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities
      concerned\\n\\n1. The lead supervisory authority shall cooperate with the other
      supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with this Article in an endeavour
      to reach consensus. The lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities
      concerned shall exchange all relevant information with each other.\\n\\n2. The
      lead supervisory authority may request at any time other supervisory authorities
      concerned to provide mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 and may conduct
      joint operations pursuant to Article 62, in particular for carrying out investigations
      or for monitoring the implementation of a measure concerning a controller or
      processor established in another Member State.\\n\\n3. The lead supervisory
      authority shall, without delay, communicate the relevant information on the
      matter to the other supervisory authorities concerned. It shall without delay
      submit a draft decision to the other supervisory authorities concerned for their
      opinion and take due account of their views.\\n\\n4. Where any of the other
      supervisory authorities concerned within a period of four weeks after having
      been consulted in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, expresses a relevant
      and reasoned objection to the draft decision, the lead supervisory authority
      shall, if it does not follow the relevant and reasoned objection or is of the
      opinion that the objection is not relevant or reasoned, submit the matter to
      the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.\\n\\n5. Where the lead
      supervisory authority intends to follow the relevant and reasoned objection
      made, it shall submit to the other supervisory authorities concerned a revised
      draft decision for their opinion. That revised draft decision shall be subject
      to the procedure referred to in paragraph 4 within a period of two weeks.\\n\\n6.
      Where none of the other supervisory authorities concerned has objected to the
      draft decision submitted by the lead supervisory authority within the period
      referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory
      authorities concerned shall be deemed to be in agreement with that draft decision
      and shall be bound by it.\\n\\n7. The lead supervisory authority shall adopt
      and notify the decision to the main establishment or single establishment of
      the controller or processor, as the case may be and inform the other supervisory
      authorities concerned and the Board of the decision in question, including a
      summary of the relevant facts and grounds. The supervisory authority with which
      a complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant on the decision.\\n\\n8.
      By derogation from paragraph 7, where a complaint is dismissed or rejected,
      the supervisory authority with which the complaint was lodged shall adopt the
      decision and notify it to the complainant and shall inform the controller thereof.\\n\\n9.
      Where the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned
      agree to dismiss or reject parts of a complaint and to act on other parts of
      that complaint, a separate decision shall be adopted for each of those parts
      of the matter. The lead supervisory authority shall adopt the decision for the
      part concerning actions in relation to the controller, shall notify it to the
      main establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor on
      the territory of its Member State and shall inform the complainant thereof,
      while the supervisory authority of the complainant shall adopt the decision
      for the part concerning dismissal or rejection of that complaint, and shall
      notify it to that complainant and shall inform the controller or processor thereof.\\n\\n10.
      After being notified of the decision of the lead supervisory authority pursuant
      to paragraphs 7 and 9, the controller or processor shall take the necessary
      measures to ensure compliance with the decision as regards processing activities
      in the context of all its establishments in the Union. The controller or processor
      shall notify the measures taken for complying with the decision to the lead
      supervisory authority, which shall inform the other supervisory authorities
      concerned.\\n\\n11. Where, in exceptional circumstances, a supervisory authority
      concerned has reasons to consider that there is an urgent need to act in order
      to protect the interests of data subjects, the urgency procedure referred to
      in Article 66 shall apply.\\n\\n12. The lead supervisory authority and the other
      supervisory authorities concerned shall supply the information required under
      this Article to each other by electronic means, using a standardised format.\\n\\nArticle
      61\\n\\nMutual assistance\\n\\n1. Supervisory authorities shall provide each
      other with relevant information and mutual assistance in order to implement
      and apply this Regulation in a consistent manner, and shall put in place measures
      for effective cooperation with one another. Mutual assistance shall cover, in
      particular, information requests and supervisory measures, such as requests
      to carry out prior authorisations and consultations, inspections and investigations.\\n\\n2.
      Each supervisory authority shall take all appropriate measures required to reply
      to a request of another supervisory authority without undue delay and no later
      than one month after receiving the request. Such measures may include, in particular,
      the transmission of relevant information on the conduct of an investigation.\\n\\n3.
      Requests for assistance shall contain all the necessary information, including
      the purpose of and reasons for the request. Information exchanged shall be used
      only for the purpose for which it was requested.\\n\\n4. The requested supervisory
      authority shall not refuse to comply with the request unless:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nit
      is not competent for the subject-matter of the request or for the measures it
      is requested to execute; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ncompliance with the request would
      infringe this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the supervisory
      authority receiving the request is subject.\\n\\n5. The requested supervisory
      authority shall inform the requesting supervisory authority of the results or,
      as the case may be, of the progress of the measures taken in order to respond
      to the request. The requested supervisory authority shall provide reasons for
      any refusal to comply with a request pursuant to paragraph 4.\\n\\n6. Requested
      supervisory authorities shall, as a rule, supply the information requested by
      other supervisory authorities by electronic means, using a standardised format.\\n\\n7.
      Requested supervisory authorities shall not charge a fee for any action taken
      by them pursuant to a request for mutual assistance. Supervisory authorities
      may agree on rules to indemnify each other for specific expenditure arising
      from the provision of mutual assistance in exceptional circumstances.\\n\\n8.
      Where a supervisory authority does not provide the information referred to in
      paragraph 5 of this Article within one month of receiving the request of another
      supervisory authority, the requesting supervisory authority may adopt a provisional
      measure on the territory of its Member State in accordance with Article 55(1).
      In that case, the urgent need to act under Article 66(1) shall be presumed to
      be met and require an urgent binding decision from the Board pursuant to Article
      66(2).\\n\\n9. The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify the
      format and procedures for mutual assistance referred to in this Article and
      the arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between
      supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board,
      in particular the standardised format referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article.
      Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination
      procedure referred to in Article 93(2).\\n\\nArticle 62\\n\\nJoint operations
      of supervisory authorities\\n\\n1. The supervisory authorities shall, where
      appropriate, conduct joint operations including joint investigations and joint
      enforcement measures in which members or staff of the supervisory authorities
      of other Member States are involved.\\n\\n2. Where the controller or processor
      has establishments in several Member States or where a significant number of
      data subjects in more than one Member State are likely to be substantially affected
      by processing operations, a supervisory authority of each of those Member States
      shall have the right to participate in joint operations. The supervisory authority
      which is competent pursuant to Article 56(1) or (4) shall invite the supervisory
      authority of each of those Member States to take part in the joint operations
      and shall respond without delay to the request of a supervisory authority to
      participate.\\n\\n3. A supervisory authority may, in accordance with Member
      State law, and with the seconding supervisory authority's authorisation, confer
      powers, including investigative powers on the seconding supervisory authority's
      members or staff involved in joint operations or, in so far as the law of the
      Member State of the host supervisory authority permits, allow the seconding
      supervisory authority's members or staff to exercise their investigative powers
      in accordance with the law of the Member State of the seconding supervisory
      authority. Such investigative powers may be exercised only under the guidance
      and in the presence of members or staff of the host supervisory authority. The
      seconding supervisory authority's members or staff shall be subject to the Member
      State law of the host supervisory authority.\\n\\n4. Where, in accordance with
      paragraph 1, staff of a seconding supervisory authority operate in another Member
      State, the Member State of the host supervisory authority shall assume responsibility
      for their actions, including liability, for any damage caused by them during
      their operations, in accordance with the law of the Member State in whose territory
      they are operating.\\n\\n5. The Member State in whose territory the damage was
      caused shall make good such damage under the conditions applicable to damage
      caused by its own staff. The Member State of the seconding supervisory authority
      whose staff has caused damage to any person in the territory of another Member
      State shall reimburse that other Member State in full any sums it has paid to
      the persons entitled on their behalf.\\n\\n6. Without prejudice to the exercise
      of its rights vis-\xE0-vis third parties and with the exception of paragraph
      5, each Member State shall refrain, in the case provided for in paragraph 1,
      from requesting reimbursement from another Member State in relation to damage
      referred to in paragraph 4.\\n\\n7. Where a joint operation is intended and
      a supervisory authority does not, within one month, comply with the obligation
      laid down in the second sentence of paragraph 2 of this Article, the other supervisory
      authorities may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its Member State
      in accordance with Article 55. In that case, the urgent need to act under Article
      66(1) shall be presumed to be met and require an opinion or an urgent binding
      decision from the Board pursuant to Article 66(2).\\n\\nSection 2\\n\\nConsistency\\n\\nArticle
      63\\n\\nConsistency mechanism\\n\\nIn order to contribute to the consistent
      application of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities
      shall cooperate with each other and, where relevant, with the Commission, through
      the consistency mechanism as set out in this Section.\\n\\nArticle 64\\n\\nOpinion
      of the Board\\n\\n1. The Board shall issue an opinion where a competent supervisory
      authority intends to adopt any of the measures below. To that end, the competent
      supervisory authority shall communicate the draft decision to the Board, when

      Any supervisory authority, the Chair of the Board or the Commission may request
      that any matter of general application or producing effects in more than one
      Member State be examined by the Board with a view to obtaining an opinion, in
      particular where a competent supervisory authority does not comply with the
      obligations for mutual assistance in accordance with Article 61 or for joint
      operations in accordance with Article 62.\\n\\n3. In the cases referred to in
      paragraphs 1 and 2, the Board shall issue an opinion on the matter submitted

      Chair of the Board by electronic means whether it will maintain or amend its
      draft decision and, if any, the amended draft decision, using a standardised
      format.\\n\\n8. Where the supervisory authority concerned informs the Chair
      of the Board within the period referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article that
      it does not intend to follow the opinion of the Board, in whole or in part,
      providing the relevant grounds, Article 65(1) shall apply.\\n\\nArticle 65\\n\\nDispute
      resolution by the Board\\n\\n1. In order to ensure the correct and consistent
      application of this Regulation in individual cases, the Board shall adopt a
      binding decision in the following cases:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nwhere, in a case referred
      to in Article 60(4), a supervisory authority concerned has raised a relevant
      and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the lead authority or the lead
      authority has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned.
      The binding decision shall concern all the matters which are the subject of
      the relevant and reasoned objection, in particular whether there is an infringement
      of this Regulation;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nwhere there are conflicting views on which
      of the supervisory authorities concerned is competent for the main establishment;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nwhere
      a competent supervisory authority does not request the opinion of the Board
      in the cases referred to in Article 64(1), or does not follow the opinion of
      the Board issued under Article 64. In that case, any supervisory authority concerned
      or the Commission may communicate the matter to the Board.\\n\\n2. The decision
      referred to in paragraph 1 shall be adopted within one month from the referral
      of the subject-matter by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Board.
      That period may be extended by a further month on account of the complexity
      of the subject-matter. The decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reasoned
      and addressed to the lead supervisory authority and all the supervisory authorities
      concerned and binding on them.\\n\\n3. Where the Board has been unable to adopt
      a decision within the periods referred to in paragraph 2, it shall adopt its
      decision within two weeks following the expiration of the second month referred
      to in paragraph 2 by a simple majority of the members of the Board. Where the
      members of the Board are split, the decision shall by adopted by the vote of
      its Chair.\\n\\n4. The supervisory authorities concerned shall not adopt a decision
      on the subject matter submitted to the Board under paragraph 1 during the periods
      referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3.\\n\\n5. The Chair of the Board shall notify,
      without undue delay, the decision referred to in paragraph 1 to the supervisory
      authorities concerned. It shall inform the Commission thereof. The decision
      shall be published on the website of the Board without delay after the supervisory
      authority has notified the final decision referred to in paragraph 6.\\n\\n6.
      The lead supervisory authority or, as the case may be, the supervisory authority
      with which the complaint has been lodged shall adopt its final decision on the
      basis of the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, without undue
      delay and at the latest by one month after the Board has notified its decision.
      The lead supervisory authority or, as the case may be, the supervisory authority
      with which the complaint has been lodged, shall inform the Board of the date
      when its final decision is notified respectively to the controller or the processor
      and to the data subject. The final decision of the supervisory authorities concerned
      shall be adopted under the terms of Article 60(7), (8) and (9). The final decision
      shall refer to the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and shall
      specify that the decision referred to in that paragraph will be published on
      the website of the Board in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article. The
      final decision shall attach the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-

      that the data protection officer does not receive any instructions regarding
      the exercise of those tasks. He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by
      the controller or the processor for performing his tasks. The data protection
      officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller
      or the processor.\\n\\n4. Data subjects may contact the data protection officer
      with regard to all issues related to processing of their personal data and to

      40\\n\\nCodes of conduct\\n\\n1. The Member States, the supervisory authorities,
      the Board and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct
      intended to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking
      account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and the specific
      needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\\n\\n2. Associations and
      other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may prepare
      codes of conduct, or amend or extend such codes, for the purpose of specifying
      the application of this Regulation, such as with regard to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nfair
      and transparent processing;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe legitimate interests pursued by
      controllers in specific contexts;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe collection of personal data;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      pseudonymisation of personal data;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nthe information provided to
      the public and to data subjects;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe exercise of the rights of
      data subjects;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nthe information provided to, and the protection
      of, children, and the manner in which the consent of the holders of parental
      responsibility over children is to be obtained;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nthe measures and
      procedures referred to in Articles 24 and 25 and the measures to ensure security
      of processing referred to in Article 32;\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nthe notification of personal
      data breaches to supervisory authorities and the communication of such personal
      data breaches to data subjects;\\n\\n(j)\\n\\nthe transfer of personal data
      to third countries or international organisations; or\\n\\n(k)\\n\\nout-of-court
      proceedings and other dispute resolution procedures for resolving disputes between
      controllers and data subjects with regard to processing, without prejudice to
      the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 77 and 79.\\n\\n3. In addition
      to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, codes
      of conduct approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article and having general
      validity pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article may also be adhered to by controllers
      or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3
      in order to provide appropriate safeguards within the framework of personal
      data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms
      referred to in point (e) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall
      make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding
      instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards including with regard to
      the rights of data subjects.\\n\\n4. A code of conduct referred to in paragraph
      2 of this Article shall contain mechanisms which enable the body referred to
      in Article 41(1) to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with its
      provisions by the controllers or processors which undertake to apply it, without
      prejudice to the tasks and powers of supervisory authorities competent pursuant
      to Article 55 or 56.\\n\\n5. Associations and other bodies referred to in paragraph
      2 of this Article which intend to prepare a code of conduct or to amend or extend
      an existing code shall submit the draft code, amendment or extension to the
      supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55. The supervisory
      authority shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension
      complies with this Regulation and shall approve that draft code, amendment or
      extension if it finds that it provides sufficient appropriate safeguards.\\n\\n6.
      Where the draft code, or amendment or extension is approved in accordance with
      paragraph 5, and where the code of conduct concerned does not relate to processing
      activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority shall register
      and publish the code.\\n\\n7. Where a draft code of conduct relates to processing
      activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority which is competent
      pursuant to Article 55 shall, before approving the draft code, amendment or
      extension, submit it in the procedure referred to in Article 63 to the Board
      which shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension
      complies with this Regulation or, in the situation referred to in paragraph
      3 of this Article, provides appropriate safeguards.\\n\\n8. Where the opinion
      referred to in paragraph 7 confirms that the draft code, amendment or extension
      complies with this Regulation, or, in the situation referred to in paragraph
      3, provides appropriate safeguards, the Board shall submit its opinion to the
      Commission.\\n\\n9. The Commission may, by way of implementing acts, decide
      that the approved code of conduct, amendment or extension submitted to it pursuant
      to paragraph 8 of this Article have general validity within the Union. Those
      implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure
      set out in Article 93(2).\\n\\n10. The Commission shall ensure appropriate publicity
      for the approved codes which have been decided as having general validity in
      accordance with paragraph 9.\\n\\n11. The Board shall collate all approved codes
      of conduct, amendments and extensions in a register and shall make them publicly
      available by way of appropriate means.\\n\\nArticle 41\\n\\nMonitoring of approved
      codes of conduct\\n\\n1. Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent
      supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, the monitoring of compliance
      with a code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 may be carried out by a body which
      has an appropriate level of expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the
      code and is accredited for that purpose by the competent supervisory authority.\\n\\n2.
      A body as referred to in paragraph 1 may be accredited to monitor compliance
      with a code of conduct where that body has:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ndemonstrated its independence
      and expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the code to the satisfaction
      of the competent supervisory authority;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nestablished procedures
      which allow it to assess the eligibility of controllers and processors concerned
      to apply the code, to monitor their compliance with its provisions and to periodically
      review its operation;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nestablished procedures and structures to
      handle complaints about infringements of the code or the manner in which the
      code has been, or is being, implemented by a controller or processor, and to
      make those procedures and structures transparent to data subjects and the public;
      and\\n\\n(d)\\n\\ndemonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory
      authority that its tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.\\n\\n3.
      The competent supervisory authority shall submit the draft criteria for accreditation
      of a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to the Board pursuant
      to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.\\n\\n4. Without prejudice
      to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority and the provisions
      of Chapter VIII, a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall,
      subject to appropriate safeguards, take appropriate action in cases of infringement
      of the code by a controller or processor, including suspension or exclusion
      of the controller or processor concerned from the code. It shall inform the
      competent supervisory authority of such actions and the reasons for taking them.\\n\\n5.
      The competent supervisory authority shall revoke the accreditation of a body
      as referred to in paragraph 1 if the conditions for accreditation are not, or
      are no longer, met or where actions taken by the body infringe this Regulation.\\n\\n6.
      This Article shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities
      and bodies.\\n\\nArticle 42\\n\\nCertification\\n\\n1. The Member States, the
      supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage, in particular
      at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms
      and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance
      with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors.
      The specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises shall be taken
      into account.\\n\\n2. In addition to adherence by controllers or processors
      subject to this Regulation, data protection certification mechanisms, seals
      or marks approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article may be established
      for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of appropriate safeguards provided
      by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant
      to Article 3 within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries
      or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (f) of Article
      46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments,
      via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate
      safeguards, including with regard to the rights of data subjects.\\n\\n3. The
      certification shall be voluntary and available via a process that is transparent.\\n\\n4.
      A certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the responsibility
      of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regulation and is
      without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities which
      are competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56.\\n\\n5. A certification pursuant
      to this Article shall be issued by the certification bodies referred to in Article
      43 or by the competent supervisory authority, on the basis of criteria approved
      by that competent supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(3) or by the
      Board pursuant to Article 63. Where the criteria are approved by the Board,
      this may result in a common certification, the European Data Protection Seal.\\n\\n6.
      The controller or processor which submits its processing to the certification
      mechanism shall provide the certification body referred to in Article 43, or
      where applicable, the competent supervisory authority, with all information
      and access to its processing activities which are necessary to conduct the certification
      procedure.\\n\\n7. Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor
      for a maximum period of three years and may be renewed, under the same conditions,
      provided that the relevant requirements continue to be met. Certification shall
      be withdrawn, as applicable, by the certification bodies referred to in Article
      43 or by the competent supervisory authority where the requirements for the
      certification are not or are no longer met.\\n\\n8. The Board shall collate
      all certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks in a register
      and shall make them publicly available by any appropriate means.\\n\\nArticle
      43\\n\\nCertification bodies\\n\\n1. Without prejudice to the tasks and powers
      of the competent supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, certification
      bodies which have an appropriate level of expertise in relation to data protection
      shall, after informing the supervisory authority in order to allow it to exercise
      its powers pursuant to point (h) of Article 58(2) where necessary, issue and
      renew certification. Member States shall ensure that those certification bodies
      are accredited by one or both of the following:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe supervisory
      authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      national accreditation body named in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008
      of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) in accordance with EN-ISO/IEC
      17065/2012 and with the additional requirements established by the supervisory
      authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56.\\n\\n2. Certification
      bodies referred to in paragraph 1 shall be accredited in accordance with that
      paragraph only where they have:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ndemonstrated their independence
      and expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the certification to the
      satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nundertaken
      to respect the criteria referred to in Article 42(5) and approved by the supervisory
      authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56 or by the Board pursuant
      to Article 63;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nestablished procedures for the issuing, periodic
      review and withdrawal of data protection certification, seals and marks;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nestablished
      procedures and structures to handle complaints about infringements of the certification
      or the manner in which the certification has been, or is being, implemented
      by the controller or processor, and to make those procedures and structures
      transparent to data subjects and the public; and\\n\\n(e)\\n\\ndemonstrated,
      to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority, that their tasks
      and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.\\n\\n3. The accreditation
      of certification bodies as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article
      shall take place on the basis of criteria approved by the supervisory authority
      which is competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56 or by the Board pursuant to
      Article 63. In the case of accreditation pursuant to point (b) of paragraph
      1 of this Article, those requirements shall complement those envisaged in Regulation
      (EC) No 765/2008 and the technical rules that describe the methods and procedures
      of the certification bodies.\\n\\n4. The certification bodies referred to in
      paragraph 1 shall be responsible for the proper assessment leading to the certification
      or the withdrawal of such certification without prejudice to the responsibility
      of the controller or processor for compliance with this Regulation. The accreditation
      shall be issued for a maximum period of five years and may be renewed on the
      same conditions provided that the certification body meets the requirements
      set out in this Article.\\n\\n5. The certification bodies referred to in paragraph
      1 shall provide the competent supervisory authorities with the reasons for granting
      or withdrawing the requested certification.\\n\\n6. The requirements referred
      to in paragraph 3 of this Article and the criteria referred to in Article 42(5)
      shall be made public by the supervisory authority in an easily accessible form.
      The supervisory authorities shall also transmit those requirements and criteria
      to the Board. The Board shall collate all certification mechanisms and data
      protection seals in a register and shall make them publicly available by any
      appropriate means.\\n\\n7. Without prejudice to Chapter VIII, the competent
      supervisory authority or the national accreditation body shall revoke an accreditation
      of a certification body pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article where the conditions
      for the accreditation are not, or are no longer, met or where actions taken
      by a certification body infringe this Regulation.\\n\\n8. The Commission shall
      be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose
      of specifying the requirements to be taken into account for the data protection
      certification mechanisms referred to in Article 42(1).\\n\\n9. The Commission
      may adopt implementing acts laying down technical standards for certification
      mechanisms and data protection seals and marks, and mechanisms to promote and
      recognise those certification mechanisms, seals and marks. Those implementing
      acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred
      to in Article 93(2).\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nTransfers of personal data to third
      countries or international organisations\\n\\nArticle 44\\n\\nGeneral principle
      for transfers\\n\\nAny transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing
      or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international
      organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this
      Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the
      controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from
      the third country or an international organisation to another third country
      or to another international organisation. All provisions in this Chapter shall
      be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons
      guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined.\\n\\nArticle 45\\n\\nTransfers
      on the basis of an adequacy decision\\n\\n1. A transfer of personal data to
      a third country or an international organisation may take place where the Commission
      has decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors
      within that third country, or the international organisation in question ensures
      an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any specific
      authorisation.\\n\\n2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection,
      the Commission shall, in particular, take account of the following elements:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, relevant legislation,
      both general and sectoral, including concerning public security, defence, national
      security and criminal law and the access of public authorities to personal data,
      as well as the implementation of such legislation, data protection rules, professional
      rules and security measures, including rules for the onward transfer of personal
      data to another third country or international organisation which are complied
      with in that country or international organisation, case-law, as well as effective
      and enforceable data subject rights and effective administrative and judicial
      redress for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities
      in the third country or to which an international organisation is subject, with
      responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with the data protection
      rules, including adequate enforcement powers, for assisting and advising the
      data subjects in exercising their rights and for cooperation with the supervisory
      authorities of the Member States; and\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe international commitments
      the third country or international organisation concerned has entered into,
      or other obligations arising from legally binding conventions or instruments
      as well as from its participation in multilateral or regional systems, in particular
      in relation to the protection of personal data.\\n\\n3. The Commission, after
      assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, may decide, by means of implementing
      act, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within
      a third country, or an international organisation ensures an adequate level
      of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing
      act shall provide for a mechanism for a periodic review, at least every four
      years, which shall take into account all relevant developments in the third
      country or international organisation. The implementing act shall specify its
      territorial and sectoral application and, where applicable, identify the supervisory
      authority or authorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article.
      The implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure
      referred to in Article 93(2).\\n\\n4. The Commission shall, on an ongoing basis,
      monitor developments in third countries and international organisations that
      could affect the functioning of decisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 of
      this Article and decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive
      95/46/EC.\\n\\n5. The Commission shall, where available information reveals,
      in particular following the review referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article,
      that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a
      third country, or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate
      level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the
      extent necessary, repeal, amend or suspend the decision referred to in paragraph
      3 of this Article by means of implementing acts without retro-active effect.
      Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination
      procedure referred to in Article 93(2).\\n\\nOn duly justified imperative grounds
      of urgency, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts
      in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 93(3).\\n\\n6. The Commission
      shall enter into consultations with the third country or international organisation
      with a view to remedying the situation giving rise to the decision made pursuant
      to paragraph 5.\\n\\n7. A decision pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article is
      without prejudice to transfers of personal data to the third country, a territory
      or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international
      organisation in question pursuant to Articles 46 to 49.\\n\\n8. The Commission
      shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union and on its website
      a list of the third countries, territories and specified sectors within a third
      country and international organisations for which it has decided that an adequate
      level of protection is or is no longer ensured.\\n\\n9. Decisions adopted by
      the Commission on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain
      in force until amended, replaced or repealed by a Commission Decision adopted
      in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5 of this Article.\\n\\nArticle 46\\n\\nTransfers
      subject to appropriate safeguards\\n\\n1. In the absence of a decision pursuant
      to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a
      third country or an international organisation only if the controller or processor
      has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data
      subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available.\\n\\n2.
      The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may be provided for, without
      requiring any specific authorisation from a supervisory authority, by:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\na
      legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nbinding
      corporate rules in accordance with Article 47;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nstandard data protection
      clauses adopted by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure
      referred to in Article 93(2);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nstandard data protection clauses
      adopted by a supervisory authority and approved by the Commission pursuant to
      the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2);\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nan approved
      code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 together with binding and enforceable
      commitments of the controller or processor in the third country to apply the
      appropriate safeguards, including as regards data subjects' rights; or\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nan
      approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 together with binding
      and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country
      to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards data subjects' rights.\\n\\n3.
      Subject to the authorisation from the competent supervisory authority, the appropriate
      safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may also be provided for, in particular,
      by:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ncontractual clauses between the controller or processor and
      the controller, processor or the recipient of the personal data in the third
      country or international organisation; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nprovisions to be inserted
      into administrative arrangements between public authorities or bodies which
      include enforceable and effective data subject rights.\\n\\n4. The supervisory
      authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 in
      the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.\\n\\n5. Authorisations
      by a Member State or supervisory authority on the basis of Article 26(2) of
      Directive 95/46/EC shall remain valid until amended, replaced or repealed, if
      necessary, by that supervisory authority. Decisions adopted by the Commission
      on the basis of Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until
      amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission Decision adopted
      in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.\\n\\nArticle 47\\n\\nBinding
      corporate rules\\n\\n1. The competent supervisory authority shall approve binding
      corporate rules in accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in Article
      63, provided that they:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nare legally binding and apply to and are
      enforced by every member concerned of the group of undertakings, or group of
      enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, including their employees;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nexpressly

      shall specify at least:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe structure and contact details of the
      group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity
      and of each of its members;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe data transfers or set of transfers,

      and the Union or a Member State, without prejudice to other grounds for transfer
      pursuant to this Chapter.\\n\\nArticle 49\\n\\nDerogations for specific situations\\n\\n1.
      In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3), or of appropriate
      safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including binding corporate rules, a transfer
      or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country or an international
      organisation shall take place only on one of the following conditions:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe
      data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having
      been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the data subject due
      to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject

      according to Union or Member State law is intended to provide information to
      the public and which is open to consultation either by the public in general
      or by any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, but only to the
      extent that the conditions laid down by Union or Member State law for consultation
      are fulfilled in the particular case.\\n\\nWhere a transfer could not be based
      on a provision in Article 45 or 46, including the provisions on binding corporate
      rules, and none of the derogations for a specific situation referred to in the
      first subparagraph of this paragraph is applicable, a transfer to a third country
      or an international organisation may take place only if the transfer is not
      repetitive, concerns only a limited number of data subjects, is necessary for
      the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which
      are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject,
      and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer
      and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard
      to the protection of personal data. The controller shall inform the supervisory
      authority of the transfer. The controller shall, in addition to providing the

      transfer and on the compelling legitimate interests pursued.\\n\\n2. A transfer
      pursuant to point (g) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall not involve
      the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the personal data
      contained in the register. Where the register is intended for consultation by
      persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer shall be made only at the
      request of those persons or if they are to be the recipients.\\n\\n3. Points
      (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and the second subparagraph
      thereof shall not apply to activities carried out by public authorities in the
      exercise of their public powers.\\n\\n4. The public interest referred to in

      reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to the transfer of specific
      categories of personal data to a third country or an international organisation.
      Member States shall notify such provisions to the Commission.\\n\\n6. The controller
      or processor shall document the assessment as well as the suitable safeguards
      referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article in the
      records referred to in Article 30.\\n\\nArticle 50\\n\\nInternational cooperation

      concerned shall exchange all relevant information with each other.\\n\\n2. The
      lead supervisory authority may request at any time other supervisory authorities
      concerned to provide mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 and may conduct
      joint operations pursuant to Article 62, in particular for carrying out investigations
      or for monitoring the implementation of a measure concerning a controller or
      processor established in another Member State.\\n\\n3. The lead supervisory
      authority shall, without delay, communicate the relevant information on the
      matter to the other supervisory authorities concerned. It shall without delay
      submit a draft decision to the other supervisory authorities concerned for their
      opinion and take due account of their views.\\n\\n4. Where any of the other
      supervisory authorities concerned within a period of four weeks after having
      been consulted in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, expresses a relevant
      and reasoned objection to the draft decision, the lead supervisory authority
      shall, if it does not follow the relevant and reasoned objection or is of the
      opinion that the objection is not relevant or reasoned, submit the matter to
      the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.\\n\\n5. Where the lead
      supervisory authority intends to follow the relevant and reasoned objection
      made, it shall submit to the other supervisory authorities concerned a revised
      draft decision for their opinion. That revised draft decision shall be subject
      to the procedure referred to in paragraph 4 within a period of two weeks.\\n\\n6.
      Where none of the other supervisory authorities concerned has objected to the
      draft decision submitted by the lead supervisory authority within the period
      referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory
      authorities concerned shall be deemed to be in agreement with that draft decision
      and shall be bound by it.\\n\\n7. The lead supervisory authority shall adopt
      and notify the decision to the main establishment or single establishment of
      the controller or processor, as the case may be and inform the other supervisory
      authorities concerned and the Board of the decision in question, including a
      summary of the relevant facts and grounds. The supervisory authority with which
      a complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant on the decision.\\n\\n8.
      By derogation from paragraph 7, where a complaint is dismissed or rejected,
      the supervisory authority with which the complaint was lodged shall adopt the
      decision and notify it to the complainant and shall inform the controller thereof.\\n\\n9.
      Where the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned
      agree to dismiss or reject parts of a complaint and to act on other parts of
      that complaint, a separate decision shall be adopted for each of those parts
      of the matter. The lead supervisory authority shall adopt the decision for the
      part concerning actions in relation to the controller, shall notify it to the
      main establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor on
      the territory of its Member State and shall inform the complainant thereof,
      while the supervisory authority of the complainant shall adopt the decision
      for the part concerning dismissal or rejection of that complaint, and shall
      notify it to that complainant and shall inform the controller or processor thereof.\\n\\n10.
      After being notified of the decision of the lead supervisory authority pursuant
      to paragraphs 7 and 9, the controller or processor shall take the necessary
      measures to ensure compliance with the decision as regards processing activities
      in the context of all its establishments in the Union. The controller or processor
      shall notify the measures taken for complying with the decision to the lead
      supervisory authority, which shall inform the other supervisory authorities
      concerned.\\n\\n11. Where, in exceptional circumstances, a supervisory authority
      concerned has reasons to consider that there is an urgent need to act in order
      to protect the interests of data subjects, the urgency procedure referred to
      in Article 66 shall apply.\\n\\n12. The lead supervisory authority and the other
      supervisory authorities concerned shall supply the information required under
      this Article to each other by electronic means, using a standardised format.\\n\\nArticle
      61\\n\\nMutual assistance\\n\\n1. Supervisory authorities shall provide each
      other with relevant information and mutual assistance in order to implement
      and apply this Regulation in a consistent manner, and shall put in place measures
      for effective cooperation with one another. Mutual assistance shall cover, in
      particular, information requests and supervisory measures, such as requests
      to carry out prior authorisations and consultations, inspections and investigations.\\n\\n2.
      Each supervisory authority shall take all appropriate measures required to reply
      to a request of another supervisory authority without undue delay and no later
      than one month after receiving the request. Such measures may include, in particular,
      the transmission of relevant information on the conduct of an investigation.\\n\\n3.
      Requests for assistance shall contain all the necessary information, including
      the purpose of and reasons for the request. Information exchanged shall be used
      only for the purpose for which it was requested.\\n\\n4. The requested supervisory
      authority shall not refuse to comply with the request unless:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nit
      is not competent for the subject-matter of the request or for the measures it
      is requested to execute; or\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ncompliance with the request would
      infringe this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the supervisory
      authority receiving the request is subject.\\n\\n5. The requested supervisory
      authority shall inform the requesting supervisory authority of the results or,
      as the case may be, of the progress of the measures taken in order to respond
      to the request. The requested supervisory authority shall provide reasons for
      any refusal to comply with a request pursuant to paragraph 4.\\n\\n6. Requested
      supervisory authorities shall, as a rule, supply the information requested by
      other supervisory authorities by electronic means, using a standardised format.\\n\\n7.
      Requested supervisory authorities shall not charge a fee for any action taken
      by them pursuant to a request for mutual assistance. Supervisory authorities
      may agree on rules to indemnify each other for specific expenditure arising
      from the provision of mutual assistance in exceptional circumstances.\\n\\n8.
      Where a supervisory authority does not provide the information referred to in
      paragraph 5 of this Article within one month of receiving the request of another
      supervisory authority, the requesting supervisory authority may adopt a provisional
      measure on the territory of its Member State in accordance with Article 55(1).
      In that case, the urgent need to act under Article 66(1) shall be presumed to
      be met and require an urgent binding decision from the Board pursuant to Article
      66(2).\\n\\n9. The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify the
      format and procedures for mutual assistance referred to in this Article and
      the arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between
      supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board,
      in particular the standardised format referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article.
      Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination
      procedure referred to in Article 93(2).\\n\\nArticle 62\\n\\nJoint operations
      of supervisory authorities\\n\\n1. The supervisory authorities shall, where
      appropriate, conduct joint operations including joint investigations and joint
      enforcement measures in which members or staff of the supervisory authorities
      of other Member States are involved.\\n\\n2. Where the controller or processor
      has establishments in several Member States or where a significant number of
      data subjects in more than one Member State are likely to be substantially affected
      by processing operations, a supervisory authority of each of those Member States
      shall have the right to participate in joint operations. The supervisory authority
      which is competent pursuant to Article 56(1) or (4) shall invite the supervisory
      authority of each of those Member States to take part in the joint operations
      and shall respond without delay to the request of a supervisory authority to
      participate.\\n\\n3. A supervisory authority may, in accordance with Member
      State law, and with the seconding supervisory authority's authorisation, confer
      powers, including investigative powers on the seconding supervisory authority's
      members or staff involved in joint operations or, in so far as the law of the
      Member State of the host supervisory authority permits, allow the seconding
      supervisory authority's members or staff to exercise their investigative powers
      in accordance with the law of the Member State of the seconding supervisory
      authority. Such investigative powers may be exercised only under the guidance
      and in the presence of members or staff of the host supervisory authority. The
      seconding supervisory authority's members or staff shall be subject to the Member
      State law of the host supervisory authority.\\n\\n4. Where, in accordance with
      paragraph 1, staff of a seconding supervisory authority operate in another Member
      State, the Member State of the host supervisory authority shall assume responsibility
      for their actions, including liability, for any damage caused by them during
      their operations, in accordance with the law of the Member State in whose territory
      they are operating.\\n\\n5. The Member State in whose territory the damage was
      caused shall make good such damage under the conditions applicable to damage
      caused by its own staff. The Member State of the seconding supervisory authority
      whose staff has caused damage to any person in the territory of another Member
      State shall reimburse that other Member State in full any sums it has paid to
      the persons entitled on their behalf.\\n\\n6. Without prejudice to the exercise
      of its rights vis-\xE0-vis third parties and with the exception of paragraph
      5, each Member State shall refrain, in the case provided for in paragraph 1,
      from requesting reimbursement from another Member State in relation to damage
      referred to in paragraph 4.\\n\\n7. Where a joint operation is intended and
      a supervisory authority does not, within one month, comply with the obligation
      laid down in the second sentence of paragraph 2 of this Article, the other supervisory
      authorities may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its Member State
      in accordance with Article 55. In that case, the urgent need to act under Article
      66(1) shall be presumed to be met and require an opinion or an urgent binding
      decision from the Board pursuant to Article 66(2).\\n\\nSection 2\\n\\nConsistency\\n\\nArticle
      63\\n\\nConsistency mechanism\\n\\nIn order to contribute to the consistent
      application of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities
      shall cooperate with each other and, where relevant, with the Commission, through
      the consistency mechanism as set out in this Section.\\n\\nArticle 64\\n\\nOpinion
      of the Board\\n\\n1. The Board shall issue an opinion where a competent supervisory
      authority intends to adopt any of the measures below. To that end, the competent
      supervisory authority shall communicate the draft decision to the Board, when
      it:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\naims to adopt a list of the processing operations subject
      to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to Article
      35(4);\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nconcerns a matter pursuant to Article 40(7) whether a draft
      code of conduct or an amendment or extension to a code of conduct complies with
      this Regulation;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\naims to approve the criteria for accreditation
      of a body pursuant to Article 41(3) or a certification body pursuant to Article
      43(3);\\n\\n(d)\\n\\naims to determine standard data protection clauses referred
      to in point (d) of Article 46(2) and in Article 28(8);\\n\\n(e)\\n\\naims to
      authorise contractual clauses referred to in point (a) of Article 46(3); or\\n\\n(f)\\n\\naims
      to approve binding corporate rules within the meaning of Article 47.\\n\\n2.
      Any supervisory authority, the Chair of the Board or the Commission may request
      that any matter of general application or producing effects in more than one
      Member State be examined by the Board with a view to obtaining an opinion, in
      particular where a competent supervisory authority does not comply with the
      obligations for mutual assistance in accordance with Article 61 or for joint
      operations in accordance with Article 62.\\n\\n3. In the cases referred to in
      paragraphs 1 and 2, the Board shall issue an opinion on the matter submitted
      to it provided that it has not already issued an opinion on the same matter.
      That opinion shall be adopted within eight weeks by simple majority of the members
      of the Board. That period may be extended by a further six weeks, taking into
      account the complexity of the subject matter. Regarding the draft decision referred
      to in paragraph 1 circulated to the members of the Board in accordance with
      paragraph 5, a member which has not objected within a reasonable period indicated
      by the Chair, shall be deemed to be in agreement with the draft decision.\\n\\n4.
      Supervisory authorities and the Commission shall, without undue delay, communicate

      1 within the period referred to in paragraph 3.\\n\\n7. The supervisory authority
      referred to in paragraph 1 shall take utmost account of the opinion of the Board
      and shall, within two weeks after receiving the opinion, communicate to the
      Chair of the Board by electronic means whether it will maintain or amend its
      draft decision and, if any, the amended draft decision, using a standardised
      format.\\n\\n8. Where the supervisory authority concerned informs the Chair
      of the Board within the period referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article that
      it does not intend to follow the opinion of the Board, in whole or in part,
      providing the relevant grounds, Article 65(1) shall apply.\\n\\nArticle 65\\n\\nDispute
      resolution by the Board\\n\\n1. In order to ensure the correct and consistent
      application of this Regulation in individual cases, the Board shall adopt a
      binding decision in the following cases:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nwhere, in a case referred
      to in Article 60(4), a supervisory authority concerned has raised a relevant
      and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the lead authority or the lead
      authority has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned.
      The binding decision shall concern all the matters which are the subject of
      the relevant and reasoned objection, in particular whether there is an infringement
      of this Regulation;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nwhere there are conflicting views on which
      of the supervisory authorities concerned is competent for the main establishment;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nwhere
      a competent supervisory authority does not request the opinion of the Board
      in the cases referred to in Article 64(1), or does not follow the opinion of
      the Board issued under Article 64. In that case, any supervisory authority concerned
      or the Commission may communicate the matter to the Board.\\n\\n2. The decision
      referred to in paragraph 1 shall be adopted within one month from the referral
      of the subject-matter by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Board.
      That period may be extended by a further month on account of the complexity
      of the subject-matter. The decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reasoned
      and addressed to the lead supervisory authority and all the supervisory authorities
      concerned and binding on them.\\n\\n3. Where the Board has been unable to adopt
      a decision within the periods referred to in paragraph 2, it shall adopt its
      decision within two weeks following the expiration of the second month referred
      to in paragraph 2 by a simple majority of the members of the Board. Where the
      members of the Board are split, the decision shall by adopted by the vote of
      its Chair.\\n\\n4. The supervisory authorities concerned shall not adopt a decision
      on the subject matter submitted to the Board under paragraph 1 during the periods

      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,

      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL

      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: behavior
      depends on the classification type explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags. For multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly one label (the
      most appropriate one even if not perfect). For multi-label concepts, leave the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to the content.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have <available_labels></available_labels> tags: if
      multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a
      single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n</extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n\\n<output_constraints>\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      procedure\\n\\n1. In exceptional circumstances, where a supervisory authority
      concerned considers that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect
      the rights and freedoms of data subjects, it may, by way of derogation from
      the consistency mechanism referred to in Articles 63, 64 and 65 or the procedure
      referred to in Article 60, immediately adopt provisional measures intended to
      produce legal effects on its own territory with a specified period of validity
      which shall not exceed three months. The supervisory authority shall, without
      delay, communicate those measures and the reasons for adopting them to the other
      supervisory authorities concerned, to the Board and to the Commission.\\n\\n2.
      Where a supervisory authority has taken a measure pursuant to paragraph 1 and
      considers that final measures need urgently be adopted, it may request an urgent
      opinion or an urgent binding decision from the Board, giving reasons for requesting
      such opinion or decision.\\n\\n3. Any supervisory authority may request an urgent
      opinion or an urgent binding decision, as the case may be, from the Board where
      a competent supervisory authority has not taken an appropriate measure in a
      situation where there is an urgent need to act, in order to protect the rights
      and freedoms of data subjects, giving reasons for requesting such opinion or
      decision, including for the urgent need to act.\\n\\n4. By derogation from Article
      64(3) and Article 65(2), an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision referred

      shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular
      in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place
      of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing
      of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation.\\n\\n2. The
      supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall inform
      the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the
      possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78.\\n\\nArticle 78\\n\\nRight
      to an effective judicial remedy against a supervisory authority\\n\\n1. Without
      prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy, each natural or
      legal person shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy against a

      Without prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy, each data
      subject shall have the right to a an effective judicial remedy where the supervisory
      authority which is competent pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 does not handle
      a complaint or does not inform the data subject within three months on the progress
      or outcome of the complaint lodged pursuant to Article 77.\\n\\n3. Proceedings
      against a supervisory authority shall be brought before the courts of the Member
      State where the supervisory authority is established.\\n\\n4. Where proceedings
      are brought against a decision of a supervisory authority which was preceded
      by an opinion or a decision of the Board in the consistency mechanism, the supervisory
      authority shall forward that opinion or decision to the court.\\n\\nArticle
      79\\n\\nRight to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor\\n\\n1.
      Without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including
      the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article
      77, each data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy where
      he or she considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed
      as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance
      with this Regulation.\\n\\n2. Proceedings against a controller or a processor
      shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller
      or processor has an establishment. Alternatively, such proceedings may be brought
      before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her
      habitual residence, unless the controller or processor is a public authority
      of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.\\n\\nArticle
      80\\n\\nRepresentation of data subjects\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have
      the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which
      has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State,

      the field of the protection of data subjects' rights and freedoms with regard
      to the protection of their personal data to lodge the complaint on his or her
      behalf, to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 77, 78 and 79 on his
      or her behalf, and to exercise the right to receive compensation referred to
      in Article 82 on his or her behalf where provided for by Member State law.\\n\\n2.
      Member States may provide that any body, organisation or association referred
      to in paragraph 1 of this Article, independently of a data subject's mandate,
      has the right to lodge, in that Member State, a complaint with the supervisory
      authority which is competent pursuant to Article 77 and to exercise the rights
      referred to in Articles 78 and 79 if it considers that the rights of a data
      subject under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing.\\n\\nArticle

      State has information on proceedings, concerning the same subject matter as
      regards processing by the same controller or processor, that are pending in
      a court in another Member State, it shall contact that court in the other Member
      State to confirm the existence of such proceedings.\\n\\n2. Where proceedings
      concerning the same subject matter as regards processing of the same controller
      or processor are pending in a court in another Member State, any competent court
      other than the court first seized may suspend its proceedings.\\n\\n3. Where
      those proceedings are pending at first instance, any court other than the court
      first seized may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction
      if the court first seized has jurisdiction over the actions in question and
      its law permits the consolidation thereof.\\n\\nArticle 82\\n\\nRight to compensation
      and liability\\n\\n1. Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage
      as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive
      compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.\\n\\n2.
      Any controller involved in processing shall be liable for the damage caused
      by processing which infringes this Regulation. A processor shall be liable for
      the damage caused by processing only where it has not complied with obligations
      of this Regulation specifically directed to processors or where it has acted
      outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the controller.\\n\\n3. A controller
      or processor shall be exempt from liability under paragraph 2 if it proves that
      it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\\n\\n4.
      Where more than one controller or processor, or both a controller and a processor,
      are involved in the same processing and where they are, under paragraphs 2 and
      3, responsible for any damage caused by processing, each controller or processor
      shall be held liable for the entire damage in order to ensure effective compensation
      of the data subject.\\n\\n5. Where a controller or processor has, in accordance
      with paragraph 4, paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that controller
      or processor shall be entitled to claim back from the other controllers or processors
      involved in the same processing that part of the compensation corresponding
      to their part of responsibility for the damage, in accordance with the conditions
      set out in paragraph 2.\\n\\n6. Court proceedings for exercising the right to
      receive compensation shall be brought before the courts competent under the
      law of the Member State referred to in Article 79(2).\\n\\nArticle 83\\n\\nGeneral
      conditions for imposing administrative fines\\n\\n1. Each supervisory authority
      shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article
      in respect of infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4,
      5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\\n\\n2.
      Administrative fines shall, depending on the circumstances of each individual
      case, be imposed in addition to, or instead of, measures referred to in points
      (a) to (h) and (j) of Article 58(2). When deciding whether to impose an administrative
      fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine in each individual
      case due regard shall be given to the following:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe nature, gravity

      of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected
      and the level of damage suffered by them;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe intentional or negligent
      character of the infringement;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nany action taken by the controller
      or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      degree of responsibility of the controller or processor taking into account
      technical and organisational measures implemented by them pursuant to Articles
      25 and 32;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nany relevant previous infringements by the controller
      or processor;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority,
      in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects
      of the infringement;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nthe categories of personal data affected
      by the infringement;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nthe manner in which the infringement became
      known to the supervisory authority, in particular whether, and if so to what
      extent, the controller or processor notified the infringement;\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nwhere
      measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the
      controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance
      with those measures;\\n\\n(j)\\n\\nadherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant
      to Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and\\n\\n(k)\\n\\nany
      other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
      case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly,
      from the infringement.\\n\\n3. If a controller or processor intentionally or
      negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several
      provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall
      not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement.\\n\\n4. Infringements
      of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject
      to administrative fines up to 10 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking,

      year, whichever is higher:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe basic principles for processing,
      including conditions for consent, pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nthe
      data subjects' rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 22;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nthe transfers
      of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organisation
      pursuant to Articles 44 to 49;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nany obligations pursuant to Member
      State law adopted under Chapter IX;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nnon-compliance with an order
      or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data
      flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) or failure to provide
      access in violation of Article 58(1).\\n\\n6. Non-compliance with an order by
      the supervisory authority as referred to in Article 58(2) shall, in accordance
      with paragraph 2 of this Article, be subject to administrative fines up to 20
      000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide
      annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\\n\\n7.
      Without prejudice to the corrective powers of supervisory authorities pursuant
      to Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down the rules on whether and to
      what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies
      established in that Member State.\\n\\n8. The exercise by the supervisory authority
      of its powers under this Article shall be subject to appropriate procedural
      safeguards in accordance with Union and Member State law, including effective
      judicial remedy and due process.\\n\\n9. Where the legal system of the Member
      State does not provide for administrative fines, this Article may be applied
      in such a manner that the fine is initiated by the competent supervisory authority
      and imposed by competent national courts, while ensuring that those legal remedies
      are effective and have an equivalent effect to the administrative fines imposed
      by supervisory authorities. In any event, the fines imposed shall be effective,
      proportionate and dissuasive. Those Member States shall notify to the Commission
      the provisions of their laws which they adopt pursuant to this paragraph by
      25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment law or amendment affecting
      them.\\n\\nArticle 84\\n\\nPenalties\\n\\n1. Member States shall lay down the
      rules on other penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation in particular
      for infringements which are not subject to administrative fines pursuant to
      Article 83, and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented.
      Such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\\n\\n2. Each
      Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which
      it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent
      amendment affecting them.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nProvisions relating to specific
      processing situations\\n\\nArticle 85\\n\\nProcessing and freedom of expression
      and information\\n\\n1. Member States shall by law reconcile the right to the
      protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation with the right to freedom
      of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes
      and the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression.\\n\\n2. For processing
      carried out for journalistic purposes or the purpose of academic artistic or
      literary expression, Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations
      from Chapter II (principles), Chapter III (rights of the data subject), Chapter
      IV (controller and processor), Chapter V (transfer of personal data to third
      countries or international organisations), Chapter VI (independent supervisory
      authorities), Chapter VII (cooperation and consistency) and Chapter IX (specific
      data processing situations) if they are necessary to reconcile the right to
      the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information.\\n\\n3.
      Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which
      it has adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment
      law or amendment affecting them.\\n\\nArticle 86\\n\\nProcessing and public
      access to official documents\\n\\nPersonal data in official documents held by
      a public authority or a public body or a private body for the performance of
      a task carried out in the public interest may be disclosed by the authority
      or body in accordance with Union or Member State law to which the public authority
      or body is subject in order to reconcile public access to official documents
      with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation.\\n\\nArticle
      87\\n\\nProcessing of the national identification number\\n\\nMember States
      may further determine the specific conditions for the processing of a national
      identification number or any other identifier of general application. In that
      case the national identification number or any other identifier of general application
      shall be used only under appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms
      of the data subject pursuant to this Regulation.\\n\\nArticle 88\\n\\nProcessing
      in the context of employment\\n\\n1. Member States may, by law or by collective
      agreements, provide for more specific rules to ensure the protection of the
      rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees' personal data
      in the employment context, in particular for the purposes of the recruitment,
      the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations
      laid down by law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation
      of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work,
      protection of employer's or customer's property and for the purposes of the
      exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or collective basis, of rights and
      benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the
      employment relationship.\\n\\n2. Those rules shall include suitable and specific
      measures to safeguard the data subject's human dignity, legitimate interests
      and fundamental rights, with particular regard to the transparency of processing,
      the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of
      enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and monitoring systems at the
      work place.\\n\\n3. Each Member State shall notify to the Commission those provisions
      of its law which it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without
      delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them.\\n\\nArticle 89\\n\\nSafeguards
      and derogations relating to processing for archiving purposes in the public
      interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes\\n\\n1.
      Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards,
      in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data
      subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures
      are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data
      minimisation. Those measures may include pseudonymisation provided that those
      purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled
      by further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the identification
      of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner.\\n\\n2.
      Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations
      from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18 and 21 subject to the conditions
      and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such
      rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of
      the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment
      of those purposes.\\n\\n3. Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations
      from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 subject to
      the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in
      so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the
      achievement of the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for
      the fulfilment of those purposes.\\n\\n4. Where processing referred to in paragraphs
      2 and 3 serves at the same time another purpose, the derogations shall apply
      only to processing for the purposes referred to in those paragraphs.\\n\\nArticle
      90\\n\\nObligations of secrecy\\n\\n1. Member States may adopt specific rules
      to set out the powers of the supervisory authorities laid down in points (e)
      and (f) of Article 58(1) in relation to controllers or processors that are subject,
      under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies,
      to an obligation of professional secrecy or other equivalent obligations of
      secrecy where this is necessary and proportionate to reconcile the right of
      the protection of personal data with the obligation of secrecy. Those rules
      shall apply only with regard to personal data which the controller or processor
      has received as a result of or has obtained in an activity covered by that obligation
      of secrecy.\\n\\n2. Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the rules
      adopted pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent
      amendment affecting them.\\n\\nArticle 91\\n\\nExisting data protection rules
      of churches and religious associations\\n\\n1. Where in a Member State, churches
      and religious associations or communities apply, at the time of entry into force
      of this Regulation, comprehensive rules relating to the protection of natural
      persons with regard to processing, such rules may continue to apply, provided
      that they are brought into line with this Regulation.\\n\\n2. Churches and religious
      associations which apply comprehensive rules in accordance with paragraph 1
      of this Article shall be subject to the supervision of an independent supervisory
      authority, which may be specific, provided that it fulfils the conditions laid
      down in Chapter VI of this Regulation.\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nDelegated acts and
      implementing acts\\n\\nArticle 92\\n\\nExercise of the delegation\\n\\n1. The
      power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the
      conditions laid down in this Article.\\n\\n2. The delegation of power referred
      to in Article 12(8) and Article 43(8) shall be conferred on the Commission for
      an indeterminate period of time from 24 May 2016.\\n\\n3. The delegation of
      power referred to in Article 12(8) and Article 43(8) may be revoked at any time
      by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision of revocation shall
      put an end to the delegation of power specified in that decision. It shall take
      effect the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of
      the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect
      the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\\n\\n4. As soon as it adopts
      a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European
      Parliament and to the Council.\\n\\n5. A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article
      12(8) and Article 43(8) shall enter into force only if no objection has been
      expressed by either the European Parliament or the Council within a period of
      three months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the
      Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and
      the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That
      period shall be extended by three months at the initiative of the European Parliament
      or of the Council.\\n\\nArticle 93\\n\\nCommittee procedure\\n\\n1. The Commission
      shall be assisted by a committee. That committee shall be a committee within
      the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\\n\\n2. Where reference is made
      to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\\n\\n3.

      will be assigned tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation
      of data within various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process
      the information and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific
      instructions provided.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\nAll
      instructions you receive will be organized using semantic XML tags for clarity
      and structure. Each section will be properly tagged to indicate its purpose
      and content type, making it easier to understand the task requirements and expected
      outputs.\\n</guidance_on_instruction_structure>\\n\\n<key_terminology>\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n  <document_definition>\\n  1. Document: A structured
      or unstructured file containing written or visual content. Documents can vary
      in type and purpose, including but not limited to:\\n    <document_types>\\n
      \   - Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\\n    - Invoices:
      Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\\n    - Curricula Vitae
      (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional experience and qualifications.\\n
      \   - Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints, photographs,
      charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\\n    -
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\\n    </document_types>\\n  \\n  Note that occasionally you
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n
      \   <content_types>\\n    Documents may contain textual or visual content:\\n
      \   - Text-based content: Written information that can be directly read and
      processed.\\n    - Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints, tables,
      handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\\n
      \   </content_types>\\n  </document_definition>\\n\\n  <aspect_definition>\\n
      \ 2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused
      attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described
      in the task. For example:\\n    <aspect_examples>\\n    - Contract Aspects:
      Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n    - Invoice Aspects:
      Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n    - CV Aspects: Work experience,
      education, or skills.\\n    </aspect_examples>\\n  You will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n
      \ </aspect_definition>\\n\\n  <concept_definition>\\n  3. Concept: A unit of
      information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from
      an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range of data
      points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to
      complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\\n    <concept_types>\\n    - Factual extractions: Such as a penalty
      clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in
      a CV.\\n    - Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations,
      or pattern identifications.\\n    - Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n
      \   - Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative
      assessments based on document content.\\n    - Label classifications: Content
      categorization using predefined labels.\\n    </concept_types>\\n  </concept_definition>\\n\\n</key_terminology>\\n\\n<critical_guidelines>\\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n\\n  <precision_and_accuracy>\\n  - Precision and
      accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\\n  </precision_and_accuracy>\\n\\n
      \ <visual_content_analysis>\\n  - Visual content analysis: When processing visual
      content (images):\\n    -- Examine all visual elements carefully, including
      text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\\n    --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n    -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\\n    -- Analyze
      information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual
      structure and relationships.\\n  </visual_content_analysis>\\n\\n  <contextual_understanding>\\n
      \ - Contextual understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions.
      A single paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding
      content, document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n  </contextual_understanding>\\n\\n
      \ <systematic_analysis>\\n  - Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly
      understand:\\n    -- The nature and type of the document\\n    -- The specific
      aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n    -- The expected output format
      and structure requirements\\n    -- Any constraints or special handling instructions\\n
      \ </systematic_analysis>\\n\\n  <quality_control>\\n  - Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\\n    -- All extracted information directly relates
      to the specified aspects/concepts\\n    -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\\n    -- No extraneous information has been included\\n    --
      All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\\n  </quality_control>\\n\\n
      \ <conservative_approach>\\n  - Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether
      information qualifies for extraction:\\n    -- If the relevance is unclear,
      err on the side of exclusion\\n    -- If multiple interpretations are possible,
      choose the most conservative one\\n    -- If information is ambiguous, do not
      force an extraction\\n  </conservative_approach>\\n\\n  <structured_output_compliance>\\n
      \ - Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format
      requirements. Do not:\\n    -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n
      \   -- Modify the structure or field names\\n    -- Include explanatory text
      outside the JSON structure\\n    -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless
      explicitly required\\n  </structured_output_compliance>\\n\\n</critical_guidelines>\\n\\n<expected_deliverables>\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n  <deliverable_types>\\n  - Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n  - Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n  - Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n  - References (when required): When required
      by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n  </deliverable_types>\\n</expected_deliverables>\\n\\n\\n<conclusion>\\nBy
      adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance
      across diverse document analysis tasks.\\n</conclusion>\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<introduction>\\nBelow
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n</introduction>\\n\\n<guidance_on_task_structure>\\nAll
      structured information in these instructions is provided using semantic XML
      tags. Field names correspond directly to tag names (e.g., concept_name, paragraph_text,
      sentence_text, additional_context, etc.).\\n</guidance_on_task_structure>\\n\\n<task_description>\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether
      each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n
      \   - Each concept is identified by a concept ID (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\",
      etc.) specified within <concept_id></concept_id> tags.\\n    - Each concept
      is described by a concept name specified within <concept_name></concept_name>
      tags and a concept description specified within <concept_description></concept_description>
      tags.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n</task_description>\\n\\n<concept_extraction_rules>\\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n
      \   - Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the
      document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n    - Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n    - Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\n    -- Provide your answer in the
      JSON format specified within <answer_format></answer_format> tags (do not include
      backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text). Follow this format
      exactly.\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have
      two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value
      of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      must be an array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract,
      leave the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified within <amount_of_extracted_items></amount_of_extracted_items>
      tags. Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n</concept_extraction_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_structure>\\n- Item
      structure:\\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      within <expected_structure></expected_structure> tags, you must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If
      a rating scale is provided for a concept within <rating_scale></rating_scale>
      tags, the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available
      labels are provided for a concept within <available_labels></available_labels>
      tags, the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the
      predefined set. The classification type is explicitly stated within <classification_type></classification_type>
      tags for each concept: for multi-class concepts, you must always select exactly
      one label (the most appropriate one even if not perfect); for multi-label concepts,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty if none of the labels apply to
      the content.\\n    -- If there are example items within <extracted_item_examples></extracted_item_examples>
      tags, try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n
      \       --- Each example is provided within separate <extracted_item_example></extracted_item_example>
      tags.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English if the
      original language of the document is not English.\\n</extracted_item_structure>\\n\\n<type_validation_rules>\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" within <extracted_item_type></extracted_item_type> tags. Ensure your
      extracted items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str
      for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object,
      etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result in invalid output.\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n</type_validation_rules>\\n\\n<extracted_item_handling_rules>\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For boolean concepts (with extracted
      item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content

      procedure\\n\\n1. In exceptional circumstances, where a supervisory authority
      concerned considers that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect
      the rights and freedoms of data subjects, it may, by way of derogation from
      the consistency mechanism referred to in Articles 63, 64 and 65 or the procedure
      referred to in Article 60, immediately adopt provisional measures intended to
      produce legal effects on its own territory with a specified period of validity

      delay, communicate those measures and the reasons for adopting them to the other
      supervisory authorities concerned, to the Board and to the Commission.\\n\\n2.
      Where a supervisory authority has taken a measure pursuant to paragraph 1 and

      such opinion or decision.\\n\\n3. Any supervisory authority may request an urgent
      opinion or an urgent binding decision, as the case may be, from the Board where

      and freedoms of data subjects, giving reasons for requesting such opinion or
      decision, including for the urgent need to act.\\n\\n4. By derogation from Article
      64(3) and Article 65(2), an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision referred

      shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular
      in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place
      of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing
      of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation.\\n\\n2. The
      supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall inform
      the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the

      79\\n\\nRight to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor\\n\\n1.
      Without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including
      the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article

      with this Regulation.\\n\\n2. Proceedings against a controller or a processor
      shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller
      or processor has an establishment. Alternatively, such proceedings may be brought
      before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her

      of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.\\n\\nArticle
      80\\n\\nRepresentation of data subjects\\n\\n1. The data subject shall have
      the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which

      State to confirm the existence of such proceedings.\\n\\n2. Where proceedings
      concerning the same subject matter as regards processing of the same controller
      or processor are pending in a court in another Member State, any competent court
      other than the court first seized may suspend its proceedings.\\n\\n3. Where
      those proceedings are pending at first instance, any court other than the court
      first seized may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction
      if the court first seized has jurisdiction over the actions in question and
      its law permits the consolidation thereof.\\n\\nArticle 82\\n\\nRight to compensation
      and liability\\n\\n1. Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage
      as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive
      compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.\\n\\n2.
      Any controller involved in processing shall be liable for the damage caused
      by processing which infringes this Regulation. A processor shall be liable for
      the damage caused by processing only where it has not complied with obligations
      of this Regulation specifically directed to processors or where it has acted
      outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the controller.\\n\\n3. A controller
      or processor shall be exempt from liability under paragraph 2 if it proves that
      it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\\n\\n4.
      Where more than one controller or processor, or both a controller and a processor,
      are involved in the same processing and where they are, under paragraphs 2 and
      3, responsible for any damage caused by processing, each controller or processor
      shall be held liable for the entire damage in order to ensure effective compensation
      of the data subject.\\n\\n5. Where a controller or processor has, in accordance
      with paragraph 4, paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that controller
      or processor shall be entitled to claim back from the other controllers or processors
      involved in the same processing that part of the compensation corresponding
      to their part of responsibility for the damage, in accordance with the conditions
      set out in paragraph 2.\\n\\n6. Court proceedings for exercising the right to
      receive compensation shall be brought before the courts competent under the
      law of the Member State referred to in Article 79(2).\\n\\nArticle 83\\n\\nGeneral

      shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article
      in respect of infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4,
      5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\\n\\n2.
      Administrative fines shall, depending on the circumstances of each individual
      case, be imposed in addition to, or instead of, measures referred to in points
      (a) to (h) and (j) of Article 58(2). When deciding whether to impose an administrative
      fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine in each individual
      case due regard shall be given to the following:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\nthe nature, gravity

      character of the infringement;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nany action taken by the controller
      or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nthe
      degree of responsibility of the controller or processor taking into account
      technical and organisational measures implemented by them pursuant to Articles
      25 and 32;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nany relevant previous infringements by the controller
      or processor;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nthe degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority,
      in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects
      of the infringement;\\n\\n(g)\\n\\nthe categories of personal data affected
      by the infringement;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\nthe manner in which the infringement became
      known to the supervisory authority, in particular whether, and if so to what
      extent, the controller or processor notified the infringement;\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nwhere
      measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the
      controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance

      to Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and\\n\\n(k)\\n\\nany
      other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
      case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly,
      from the infringement.\\n\\n3. If a controller or processor intentionally or
      negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several
      provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall
      not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement.\\n\\n4. Infringements
      of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject
      to administrative fines up to 10 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking,

      State law adopted under Chapter IX;\\n\\n(e)\\n\\nnon-compliance with an order
      or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data
      flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) or failure to provide
      access in violation of Article 58(1).\\n\\n6. Non-compliance with an order by
      the supervisory authority as referred to in Article 58(2) shall, in accordance
      with paragraph 2 of this Article, be subject to administrative fines up to 20
      000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide
      annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\\n\\n7.
      Without prejudice to the corrective powers of supervisory authorities pursuant
      to Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down the rules on whether and to
      what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies
      established in that Member State.\\n\\n8. The exercise by the supervisory authority
      of its powers under this Article shall be subject to appropriate procedural
      safeguards in accordance with Union and Member State law, including effective
      judicial remedy and due process.\\n\\n9. Where the legal system of the Member
      State does not provide for administrative fines, this Article may be applied
      in such a manner that the fine is initiated by the competent supervisory authority
      and imposed by competent national courts, while ensuring that those legal remedies
      are effective and have an equivalent effect to the administrative fines imposed
      by supervisory authorities. In any event, the fines imposed shall be effective,
      proportionate and dissuasive. Those Member States shall notify to the Commission
      the provisions of their laws which they adopt pursuant to this paragraph by

      Such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\\n\\n2. Each
      Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which
      it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent

      and information\\n\\n1. Member States shall by law reconcile the right to the
      protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation with the right to freedom
      of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes
      and the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression.\\n\\n2. For processing
      carried out for journalistic purposes or the purpose of academic artistic or
      literary expression, Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations
      from Chapter II (principles), Chapter III (rights of the data subject), Chapter
      IV (controller and processor), Chapter V (transfer of personal data to third
      countries or international organisations), Chapter VI (independent supervisory
      authorities), Chapter VII (cooperation and consistency) and Chapter IX (specific
      data processing situations) if they are necessary to reconcile the right to
      the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information.\\n\\n3.
      Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which
      it has adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment

      a task carried out in the public interest may be disclosed by the authority
      or body in accordance with Union or Member State law to which the public authority
      or body is subject in order to reconcile public access to official documents
      with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation.\\n\\nArticle
      87\\n\\nProcessing of the national identification number\\n\\nMember States
      may further determine the specific conditions for the processing of a national
      identification number or any other identifier of general application. In that
      case the national identification number or any other identifier of general application
      shall be used only under appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms
      of the data subject pursuant to this Regulation.\\n\\nArticle 88\\n\\nProcessing
      in the context of employment\\n\\n1. Member States may, by law or by collective
      agreements, provide for more specific rules to ensure the protection of the
      rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees' personal data
      in the employment context, in particular for the purposes of the recruitment,
      the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations
      laid down by law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation
      of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work,
      protection of employer's or customer's property and for the purposes of the
      exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or collective basis, of rights and
      benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the
      employment relationship.\\n\\n2. Those rules shall include suitable and specific
      measures to safeguard the data subject's human dignity, legitimate interests

      work place.\\n\\n3. Each Member State shall notify to the Commission those provisions
      of its law which it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without
      delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them.\\n\\nArticle 89\\n\\nSafeguards
      and derogations relating to processing for archiving purposes in the public
      interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes\\n\\n1.
      Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
      research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards,
      in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data
      subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures
      are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data
      minimisation. Those measures may include pseudonymisation provided that those
      purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled
      by further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the identification
      of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner.\\n\\n2.
      Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes
      or statistical purposes, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations
      from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18 and 21 subject to the conditions
      and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such
      rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of
      the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment
      of those purposes.\\n\\n3. Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes
      in the public interest, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations
      from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 subject to
      the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in
      so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the
      achievement of the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for
      the fulfilment of those purposes.\\n\\n4. Where processing referred to in paragraphs
      2 and 3 serves at the same time another purpose, the derogations shall apply
      only to processing for the purposes referred to in those paragraphs.\\n\\nArticle
      90\\n\\nObligations of secrecy\\n\\n1. Member States may adopt specific rules
      to set out the powers of the supervisory authorities laid down in points (e)
      and (f) of Article 58(1) in relation to controllers or processors that are subject,
      under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies,
      to an obligation of professional secrecy or other equivalent obligations of
      secrecy where this is necessary and proportionate to reconcile the right of
      the protection of personal data with the obligation of secrecy. Those rules
      shall apply only with regard to personal data which the controller or processor
      has received as a result of or has obtained in an activity covered by that obligation
      of secrecy.\\n\\n2. Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the rules
      adopted pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent
      amendment affecting them.\\n\\nArticle 91\\n\\nExisting data protection rules
      of churches and religious associations\\n\\n1. Where in a Member State, churches
      and religious associations or communities apply, at the time of entry into force
      of this Regulation, comprehensive rules relating to the protection of natural
      persons with regard to processing, such rules may continue to apply, provided
      that they are brought into line with this Regulation.\\n\\n2. Churches and religious
      associations which apply comprehensive rules in accordance with paragraph 1
      of this Article shall be subject to the supervision of an independent supervisory
      authority, which may be specific, provided that it fulfils the conditions laid
      down in Chapter VI of this Regulation.\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nDelegated acts and
      implementing acts\\n\\nArticle 92\\n\\nExercise of the delegation\\n\\n1. The
      power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the
      conditions laid down in this Article.\\n\\n2. The delegation of power referred
      to in Article 12(8) and Article 43(8) shall be conferred on the Commission for
      an indeterminate period of time from 24 May 2016.\\n\\n3. The delegation of
      power referred to in Article 12(8) and Article 43(8) may be revoked at any time
      by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision of revocation shall
      put an end to the delegation of power specified in that decision. It shall take
      effect the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of
      the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect
      the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\\n\\n4. As soon as it adopts
      a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European
      Parliament and to the Council.\\n\\n5. A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article
      12(8) and Article 43(8) shall enter into force only if no objection has been
      expressed by either the European Parliament or the Council within a period of
      three months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the
      Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and
      the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That
      period shall be extended by three months at the initiative of the European Parliament
      or of the Council.\\n\\nArticle 93\\n\\nCommittee procedure\\n\\n1. The Commission
      shall be assisted by a committee. That committee shall be a committee within
      the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\\n\\n2. Where reference is made
      to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\\n\\n3.
